Download PDF From 2035, no extra seconds will be added to bring clocks in sync with astronomical time.Credit: Adam Smigielski/Getty The practice of adding \xe2\x80\x98leap seconds\xe2\x80\x99 to official clocks to keep them in sync with Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation will be put on hold from 2035, the world\xe2\x80\x99s foremost metrology body has decided.The decision was made by representatives from governments worldwide at the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) outside Paris on 18 November. It means that from 2035, or possibly earlier, astronomical time (known as UT1) will be allowed to diverge by more than one second from coordinated universal time (UTC), which is based on the steady tick of atomic clocks. Since 1972, whenever the two time systems have drifted apart by more than 0.9 seconds, a leap second has been added. How many yottabytes in a quettabyte? Extreme numbers get new names Stopping the adjustments is \xe2\x80\x9ca leap forward\xe2\x80\x9d for researchers who work on time and frequency, says Georgette Macdonald, director general of the Metrology Research Centre in Halifax, Canada. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased their efforts got us to this moment.\xe2\x80\x9dLeap seconds aren\xe2\x80\x99t predictable, because they depend on to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s natural rotation. They disrupt systems based on precise timekeeping, Macdonald says, and can wreak havoc in the digital age. Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, Meta, and Google are among the tech companies that have called for leap seconds to be scrapped.The CGPM \xe2\x80\x94 which also oversees the international system of units (SI) \xe2\x80\x94 has proposed that no leap second should be added for at least a century, allowing UT1 and UTC to slide out of sync by about 1 minute. But it plans to consult with other international organizations and decide by 2026 on what upper limit, if any, to put on how much they be allowed to diverge.Time for changeRepresentatives from Canada, the United States and France were among those at the CGPM who called for the leap second to be scrapped before 2035. But Russia, which voted against the proposal, wants to push it back to 2040 or later to deal with technical issues within its satellite-navigation system, GLONASS.The Russian system incorporates leap seconds, while the Global Position System (GPS) and others already effectively ignore them. The decision means that Russia might need to install new satellites and ground stations, says Felicitas Arias, former director of the Time Department at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in S\xc3\xa8vres, France.Astronomers who rely on UT1 to align their telescopes will also need to adjust, says Elizabeth Donley, who leads the Time and Frequency division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in Boulder, Colorado. But the current situation is unsustainable and would continue to get worse, she adds. Different organisations handle the leap second differently (Google, for example, smears out the extra second in the 24 hours around midnight UTC). This creates an ambiguity between time sources of as much as half a second, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is huge.\xe2\x80\x9d Leap-second decision delayed by eight years Although in the long term Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation slows due to the pull of the Moon, a speed-up since 2020 has also made the issue more pressing, because for the first time, a leap second might need to be removed, rather than added. UTC has only ever had to slow a beat to wait for Earth, not skip ahead to catch up with it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's kind of being described as a Y2K issue, because it's just something that we've never had to deal with,\xe2\x80\x9d Donley says.There is a chance that the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) could stymie plans to make the switch in 2035. The body effectively ceded decision making about the leap second to the CGPM in 2015, and Arias says its working group agreed with the CGPM\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. But the ITU remains in control of disseminating UTC, and could argue that the time is not right to make the change, she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the thing that makes us a little bit nervous.\xe2\x80\x9dSubtle differenceAlthough human timepieces have been calibrated with Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation for millennia, most people will feel little effect from the loss of the leap second. \xe2\x80\x9cIn most countries, there is a one hour step between summertime and winter time,\xe2\x80\x9d says Arias. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is much more than one second, but it doesn't affect you.\xe2\x80\x9dFuture metrologists might find more elegant ways than the leap second to realign UTC and UT1. At the point where the difference becomes significant, \xe2\x80\x9cour ability to reconcile it will be better than what our ability is right now\xe2\x80\x9d, says Macdonald.Or they might not bother, Arias adds. When the difference becomes big enough, countries could permanently shift their legal time zone by one hour, she says. Or we could even decouple our sense of time from the Sun entirely, to create a single world time zone in which different countries see the Sun overhead at different times of day or night. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be a solution,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cScience already doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use local times, we talk in UTC.\xe2\x80\x9d doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-022-03783-5 Related Articles Leap-second decision delayed by eight years How many yottabytes in a quettabyte?

4,Tailscale Funnel (tailscale.com),https://tailscale.com/blog/introducing-tailscale-funnel/,642,"b'Introducing Tailscale Funnel \xc2\xb7 Tailscale Pricing Customers Download Blog Docs Log In Use Tailscale Log In Use Tailscale Pricing Docs Download Customers Blog Introducing Tailscale\xc2\xa0Funnel Brad Fitzpatrick, Maisem Ali, Sonia Appasamy, Anton Tolchanov and Shayne Sweeney on November 17, 2022 Tailscale lets you put all your devices on their own private tailnet so they can reach each other, ACLs permitting. Usually that\xe2\x80\x99s nice and comforting, knowing that all your devices can then be isolated from the internet, without any ports needing to be open to the world. Sometimes, though, you need something from the big, scary, non-Tailscale internet to be able to reach your device. Maybe you need to receive a webhook from GitHub. Maybe you want to briefly test a website you\xe2\x80\x99re working on using a coworker\xe2\x80\x99s phone. Or maybe you even want to host your personal blog or a small Mastodon server on your own computer. For any of that to work, though, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need an address the other parties can access. Shockingly, the whole world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use Tailscale. (We\xe2\x80\x99re working on that.) So you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a publicly routable IP address, a TLS cert (hopefully!), and then necessarily a DNS name for the cert. Tailscale gives you a DNS name and supports your Tailscale node getting its own Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt cert for that DNS name, but your Tailscale IP addresses aren\xe2\x80\x99t publicly routable, so those webhooks from GitHub or ActivityPub toots can\xe2\x80\x99t reach you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not really on the internet without a public IP address. Yes, you could spin up a $5/month VM somewhere and forward a port from its public internet IP to your tailnet with one line in your rinetd.conf file. But is that fun? Do you really need a(nother) Linux VM in your life? Here\xe2\x80\x99s something more fun: Tailscale Funnel. You can now expose things from your Tailscale node to the big scary internet and we\xe2\x80\x99ll tunnel it in to you, over Tailscale. How it works \xe2\x80\x9cMy VPN is exposed to the internet!!?\xe2\x80\x9d we hear you screaming. We\xe2\x80\x99re also the worrying sort, so let\xe2\x80\x99s walk through how it works. Hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it less scary. First off, rest assured that Tailscale Funnel is all off by default and double opt-in: It needs to be both enabled in the Tailscale admin console by a tailnet admin and enabled on the device running Tailscale. When enabled, two things happen: The first thing we do is set up public DNS records for your node.tailnet.ts.net MagicDNS name to point to public IP addresses of new servers we\xe2\x80\x99re now running. These new Funnel frontends (funends?) are georeplicated around the world, similar to how we run DERP servers around the world. Tailscale Funnel runs on distinct services, VMs, and networks from DERP, but they\xe2\x80\x99re similar in that they\xe2\x80\x99re both hosted by Tailscale. (Like DERP, which you can run yourself, you could also do an rinetd thing yourself for this, if you find that more fun.) The second thing we do is add those Funnel ingress nodes to your tailnet\xe2\x80\x99s list of Tailscale peers. On nodes where Tailscale Funnel is enabled you\xe2\x80\x99ll see them in tailscale serve status --json. Those peers will be named funnel-ingress-node and are sent with a bit set marking them as funnel peers. That bit prevents them from having any packet-level access to your tailnet. The only thing they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to do is offer your node a funneled TCP connection, which your node can accept or reject, depending on how it\xe2\x80\x99s configured. (That magic bit will make an appearance in a future blog post; stay tuned!) The way the Funnel ingress nodes are allowed to send a connection offer to your nodes is using Tailscale\xe2\x80\x99s inter-node \xe2\x80\x9cpeerapi\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism that we originally added for Taildrop. With peerapi, each Tailscale node allocates a reserved ephemeral port number to be its inter-node RPC port. Those peerapi RPCs are then just HTTP requests over that port. TCP connections to that port are then intercepted by Tailscale after the WireGuard\xc2\xae decryption, before they hit your operating system. In fact, they\xe2\x80\x99re never delivered to your operating system: We handle the packets and TCP internally with gVisor\xe2\x80\x99s netstack, like we do for Tailscale SSH. When somebody goes to node.tailnet.ts.net in their browser (or other client), a traditional DNS response then points to one of our funnel VMs, ideally in a region near your node. We then accept those TCP connections from end users (which must be TLS), look at the SNI name in the TLS ClientHello, and then proxy those encrypted TCP connections to your Tailscale node over Tailscale itself. Notably, we\xe2\x80\x99re only proxying a TCP connection (which we verified has a valid SNI name in it); Tailscale Funnel is not doing any TLS termination. While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that we could in theory terminate TLS (as we own ts.net and could get our own Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt certs for it), we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, and you can verify in the public Certificate Transparency logs that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re proxying a TCP connection to your node. But remember, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have packet-level access to your nodes, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not just proxying our public TCP port 443 to your node\xe2\x80\x99s port 443. Instead, our Funnel ingress nodes send one of those aforementioned \xe2\x80\x9cpeerapi\xe2\x80\x9d requests to your node: an HTTP request where the request says the source IP:port and target SNI name and port. Your node then receives that peerapi HTTP request and decides for itself, based on configuration that lives only on your Tailscale node: Does it want that TCP connection for that tuple? If not, it rejects it. If so, what should it do with it? At a high level, there are two main things Tailscale Funnel can do with that incoming connection. In either case, something on your device has to terminate TLS. The first thing you can do is just pass off the TCP connection to a local webserver and let that webserver do the HTTPS. Both Caddy and Apache have support for terminating TLS via Tailscale\xe2\x80\x99s certificate fetching mechanism, for example. The second thing you can do is have your device\xe2\x80\x99s Tailscale daemon itself terminate TLS. Then it can reverse proxy the HTTP requests to a local non-HTTPS webserver. That is, you run a webserver on localhost:8080 and we put it on the internet, complete with a public IP address, DNS, TLS cert, and HTTPS server. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s a fun tunnel, if we do say so ourselves. Now in alpha Tailscale Funnel is now in alpha. To start, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to limit the number of testers and ramp up a bit slowly as we build confidence that all the infrastructure is working. The first batch of users can join the alpha by following this link. The functionality will be available in a stable release starting in Tailscale v1.34.0 but meanwhile you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be running a recent unstable build (v1.33.257 or later) to try it out. After alpha we\xe2\x80\x99ll start opening this up more widely, hopefully soon! In the meantime, check out the documentation.

7,Investigating why Steam started picking a random font (pkh.me),http://blog.pkh.me/p/35-investigating-why-steam-started-picking-a-random-font.html,441,"b'Investigating why Steam started picking a random font \xe2\x86\x90 indexInvestigating why Steam started picking a random font 2022-11-18 debug, fun, sysadmin Out of the blue my Steam started picking a random font I had in my user fonts dir: Virgil, the Excalidraw font. That triggered me all sorts of emotions, ranging from laugh to total incredulity. I initially thought the root cause was a random derping from Valve but the Internet seemed quiet about it, so the unreasonable idea that it might have been my fault surfaced. To understand how it came to this, I have to tell you about The Stanley Parable, an incredibly funny game I highly recommend. One of the achievement of the game is to not play it for 5 years. To get it, I disabled NTP, changed my system clock to 2030, started the game, enjoyed my achievement and restored NTP. So far so good, mission is a success, I can move on with my life. But not satisfied with this first victory I soon wanted to achieve the same in the Ultra Deluxe edition. This one comes with the same achievement, except it\'s 10 years instead of 5. Since 2022+10 is too hard of a mental calculation for me I rounded it up to 2040, and followed the same procedure as previously. Achievement unlocked, easy peasy. Problem is, Steam accessed many files during that short lapse of time, which caused them to have their access time updated to 2040. And you know what\'s special about 2040? It\'s after 2038. Get it yet? Here is a hint: Year 2038 problem. This is the kind of error I was seeing in the console: ""/usr/share/fonts"": Value too large for defined data type. What kind of error could that be? % errno -s ""Value too large"" EOVERFLOW 75 Value too large for defined data type Nice, so we\'re triggering an overflow somewhere. More precisely, fontconfig 32-bit (an underlying code to be exact) was going mad crazy because of this: % stat /etc/fonts/conf.d/*|grep 2040 Access: 2040-11-22 00:00:04.110328309 +0100 Access: 2040-11-22 00:00:04.110328309 +0100 Access: 2040-11-22 00:00:04.110328309 +0100 ... In order to fix this mess I had to be a bit brutal: % sudo mount -o remount,strictatime / % sudo mount -o remount,strictatime /home % sudo find / -newerat 2039-12-31 -exec touch -a {} + % sudo mount -o remount,relatime / % sudo mount -o remount,relatime /home The remounts were needed because relatime is the default, which means file accesses get updated only if the current time is past the access time. And I had to remount both my root and home partition because Steam touched files everywhere. Not gonna lie, this self-inflicted bug brought quite a few life lessons to me: The Stanley Parable meta-game has no limit to madness 2038 is going to be a lot of fun 32-bit games preservation is a sad state of affair For updates and more frequent content you can follow me on Twitter or Mastodon.

Alpert comments The transfer of $477 million of crypto out FTX accounts last weekend raised worries of theft, but is part of a fight over control of the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy. Officials in the Bahamas have challenged FTX\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy administrators in the U.S. over control of the remains of the company. (Photo Illustration by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Remember that hack of nearly half a\xc2\xa0 billion dollars in cryptocurrency from bankrupt FTX last weekend? Turns out it was actually a government asset seizure. The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has now acknowledged that it was behind the removal of $477 million in crypto assets from the bankrupt exchange on Nov. 12. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Securities Commission of the Bahamas, in the exercise of its powers as regulator acting under the authority of an order made by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas, took the action of directing the transfer of all the digital assets of FTX Digital Markets Ltd. to a digital wallet controlled by the commission, for safekeeping,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency said in a statement. The transfer occurred the day after FTX had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware and immediately sparked concerns of a major hack. The company announced that day that \xe2\x80\x9cunauthorized access to certain assets has occurred\xe2\x80\x9d and that they were coordinating with law enforcement on the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d On Thursday, the U.S.-based bankruptcy administrators led by John Ray, III, who have taken control of FTX, said in court filings that they had \xe2\x80\x9ccredible evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that officials in the Bahamas had directed FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to access FTX\xe2\x80\x99s systems after the Chapter 11 filing, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of obtaining digital assets of the debtors.\xe2\x80\x9d The seizure of assets came amid an emerging fight for control over the direction of the bankruptcy proceeding, with officials in the Bahamas filing a separate Chapter 15 bankruptcy petition in federal court in New York on Nov. 15. That filing was on behalf of FTX Digital Markets Ltd., a subsidiary that managed significant aspects of the company\xe2\x80\x99s operations from its headquarters in the Caribbean island nation.\xc2\xa0 A Chapter 15 filing is used typically in cases involving companies with debtors in multiple countries. In its statement, the Bahamian Securities Commission said it believed FTX Digital Markets was not part of the Delaware bankruptcy proceeding. The administrators of the Delaware bankruptcy have asked the judge in their case to combine the cases, saying that it was duplicative and confusing to keep them separate. The judge scheduled a hearing on the matter for Monday. The administrators of the Delaware case have accused Bankman-Fried of attempting to undermine their efforts to sort out the mess he left behind by pushing the second bankruptcy case brought by Bahamian officials.

14,Consider working on genomics (claymcleod.dev),https://claymcleod.dev/blog/2022-11-19-consider-working-on-genomics.html,311,"b'Consider working on genomics Consider working on genomics Genomics needs more talented software engineers. There is a significant gap between how software is currently developed in this space versus how it should be developed. The vast majority of genomics-related software is not written with speed or reliability in mind. Too often, projects have no documentation within the code itself and no tests. Instead, a single individual who built the tool and has worked with the code since its inception is solely responsible for ensuring that the results ""still look good"" between releases (in an ad hoc manner, no less)\xe2\x80\x94a claim that I think is incredibly generous given the breadth and complexity of evaluating genomics results. This state of affairs makes it difficult for anyone other than the original author to contribute to these code bases, further cementing the one-maintainer policy. This is not a good position for our field to be in. Many of the projects that are critical to the foundation of genomics are reaching or have eclipsed the ten-year mark. How much longer can we expect these individuals to single-handedly maintain these code bases? Further, without repeatable end-to-end testing, how can we be sure results aren\'t shifting over time in ways that are detrimental? Of course, this would not be the fault of the individuals who maintain the software, who are often brilliant: it\'s just simply not fair to expect individuals to ensure this consistency using their own, ad-hoc processses. This field is ripe for innovation, particularly around the way we develop software, and I believe a revolution of sorts is needed to ensure the future viability of genomics at scale. Much of this innovation will likely be driven by software engineers who come in and learn the domain. From my experience, what works incredibly well is a partnership between biologists and software engineers: the biologists first come up with the first concept of the tool, which is purely focused on ensuring good results. After this first iteration is completed, engineers then come in and rewrite the tool using modern engineering practices with things like speed and reliability in mind. So, if you\'re a software engineer who enjoys working on the cutting edge and wants to put your talents to work on something impactful, my charge to you is to consider joining the field of genomics. Contrary to when I started, there exists some relatively good material for testing out the waters in this fascinating domain (for example, just last week we published the learngenomics.dev site aimed at teaching software engineers the basics of genomics and bioinformatics). Often, it\'s not required to know the domain before you join a group, and they will teach you on the job. For those interested, here are the places hiring in this space that I am aware of. Please reach out to me on social media if you know of more places that are hiring in this area. Note that this is not an endorsement of any particular organization or company, this is simply listing organizations that might be hiring for awareness\xe2\x80\x94you\'ll have to do your own due dilligence to determine which one might be right for you.

This light has been stretched by the expansion of the Universe and arrives at us as radiowaves. It is called the Cosmic Microwave Background. See the sky view. redshifted quasars At these distances, the expansion of the Universe is so great that the blue photons from quasars get stretched and appear redder. A bit farther, we encounter an epoch during which the Universe is filled with hydrogen gas that prevents the propagation of visible light we could observe today. This epoch is called the ""dark ages"". See the sky view. quasars Quasars are massive black holes located at the center of certain galaxies. As they accrete surrounding gas and stars, they become extremely bright and can be seen across the Universe. Their light is blueish. See the sky view. Beyond this distance, galaxies are harder to see. However, we can still see quasars. They are much brighter and bluer. redshifted elliptical galaxies As the Universe expands, photons gets stretched and objects appear redder. This is the case for the elliptical galaxies. At these distances, they appear red to us.As we no longer detect the fainter spiral galaxies, the filamentary structure is less visible.

This map shows a slice of our Universe. It was created from astronomical data taken night after night over a period of 15 years using a telescope in New Mexico, USA. We are located at the bottom. At the top is the actual edge of the observable Universe. In between, we see about 200,000 galaxies. The full map is actually a sphere. This visualization shows a thin slice of the Universe. Its thickness is about 10 degrees. More astronomical data is available but it is not possible to show all of it at once on a 2D map. The image would be completely saturated with dots. What are these dots? Each tiny dot is a galaxy. About 200,000 are shown with their actual position and color. Each galaxy contains billions of stars and planets. We are located at the bottom. Our galaxy, the Milky Way is just a dot. Looking up, we see that space is filled with galaxies forming a global filamentary structure. Far away from us (higher up in the map), the filaments become harder to see. Why are the colors changing? The Universe expands with time. This expansion stretches the wavelength of light. The farther an object, the redder it will appear to us. The map shows two blue-to-red redshift sequences: one for galaxies (lower half) and one for quasars (upper half). Why is there an edge? The top of the map reveals the first flash of radiation emitted soon after the Big Bang. This happened 13.7 billion years ago. Today we observe this radiation not as visible light but as radio waves. It is called the Cosmic Microwave Background. It is the edge of the observable Universe. Any light emitted beyond that has not yet reached us as its travel time is longer than the age of the Universe. Why are we at the center? Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is not located at any special position in space. The expansion of the Universe and the redshift effect makes all other galaxies appear redder as we look farther. This map would look similarly if we were looking at the Universe from another galaxy. Which telescope was used? Observations were conducted using a dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. This project is called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

PDFSyntax is lightweight (no dependencies) and written from scratch in pure Python. CLI: It started as a command-line interface to inspect the internal structure of a PDF file: the PDF source is pretty-printed and augmented with hyperlinks in a static HTML file. API: Now the internal functions are being exposed as a tooklit for PDF read/write operations. It is mostly made of simple functions working on built-in types and named tuples. Shallow copying of the Doc object structure performed by pure functions offers some kind of - experimental - immutability. PDFSyntax favors non-destructive edits allowed by the PDF Specification: by default incremental updates are added at the end of the original file. Project status WORK IN PROGRESS! This is ALPHA quality software. CLI Features The generated HTML looks like the raw PDF file with the following additions: Pretty-print dictionary object Extract an object contained in an object stream and insert it in the flow like a regular object Decompress stream and display a small part of it Turn indirect object reference into hyperlink Turn offset reference (for example a /Prev entry) into hyperlink Put some color on key names (for example /Type) Display offset of an object Screenshot Usage Generate the HTML file and open it in your browser: python3 -m pdfsyntax inspect file.pdf > inspection.html API Usage Most functions are pure and are exposed both as basic functions and as instance methods of a Doc object: in the function signatures found in the following sections, a doc first argument can read as self. For example both samples are equivalent: >>> #Function pattern >>> from pdfsyntax import read, metadata >>> doc = read(""samples/simple_text_string.pdf"") >>> m = metadata(doc) >>> #Method pattern >>> import pdfsyntax as pdf >>> doc = pdf.read(""samples/simple_text_string.pdf"") >>> m = doc.metadata() File information structure and metadata are functions showing general information about the document. >>> #File structure >>> structure(doc) {\'Version\': \'1.4\', \'Pages\': 1, \'Revisions\': 1, \'Encrypted\': False, \'Paper\': \'215x279mm or 8.5x11.0in (US Letter)\'} >>> #File structure >>> metadata(doc) {\'Title\': None, \'Author\': None, \'Subject\': None, \'Keywords\': None, \'Creator\': None, \'Producer\': None, \'CreationDate\': None, \'ModDate\': None} Low-level access to object tree trailer and catalog give access to the starting point of the object tree. >>> #Access to document trailer >>> doc.trailer() {\'/Root\': 1j, \'/Size\': 8, \'/Prev\': 603} >>> #Access to document catalog as specified in the /Root entry of the trailer >>> doc.catalog() {\'/Pages\': 3j, \'/Outlines\': 2j, \'/Type\': \'/Catalog\'} 1j is a complex number (!) representing indirect reference 1 0 R. Why? Because the approach is to map PDF object types to Python basic built-in types as much as possible, and it is a concise way to show both the object number (as the imaginary part) and the generation number (as the real part). Moreover the generation is very often equal to zero, so the real part is not shown. You may think of the j as a ""jump"" to another object :) get_object gives direct access to indirect objects. >>> #Access to document catalog, given that the trailer redirects to 1j for root >>> #(equivalent to catalog fonction) >>> doc.get_object(1j) {\'/Pages\': 3j, \'/Outlines\': 2j, \'/Type\': \'/Catalog\'} Incremental updates PDFSyntax tracks document incremental updates made possible by appending new or updated objects at the end of an original PDF file (and the matching XREF section). The Revisions entry of the structure function result, if greater than 1, indicates that incremental updates have been appended. By default, a newly opened document by PDFSyntax is ready to write modifications in the next revision. The rewind function rolls back to the previous revision. >>> import pdfsyntax as pdf >>> doc = pdf.read(""samples/add_text_annotation.pdf"") >>> doc.structure() {\'Version\': \'1.4\', \'Pages\': 1, \'Revisions\': 2, \'Encrypted\': False, \'Paper\': \'215x279mm or 8.5x11.0in (US Letter)\'} >>> #This file contains 2 revisions and PDFSyntax has initialized the doc object for a future revision 3 >>> doc.get_object(4j) {\'/Annots\': 8j, \'/Resources\': {\'/Font\': {\'/F1\': 7j}, \'/ProcSet\': 6j}, \'/Contents\': 5j, \'/MediaBox\': [0, 0, 612, 792], \'/Parent\': 3j, \'/Type\': \'/Page\'} >>> #In its current state, the page (object 4) contains an annotation >>> #Let\'s rewind to revision 1 >>> doc = doc.rewind() # to revision 2 >>> doc = doc.rewind() # to revision 1 >>> doc.get_object(4j) {\'/Resources\': {\'/Font\': {\'/F1\': 7j}, \'/ProcSet\': 6j}, \'/Contents\': 5j, \'/MediaBox\': [0, 0, 612, 792], \'/Parent\': 3j, \'/Type\': \'/Page\'} >>> #The annotation was not present in the initial revision of the file Transformation rotate turns pages relatively to their current position by multiples of 90 degrees clockwise. NB: It takes into account the inherited attributes from the page hierarchy. >>> #Default rotation applies 90 degrees to all pages >>> doc90 = rotate(doc) >>> #Apply 180 degrees to first two page >>> doc180 = doc.rotate(180, [1, 2]) TO BE CONTINUED About A Python PDF parsing library and tool built on top to browse the internal structure of a PDF file Topics python api pdf parser library inspector pdfsyntax Resources Readme License MIT license Stars 310 stars Watchers 6 watching Forks 7 forks Releases 5 tags Languages Python 99.4% Makefile 0.6% Footer \xc2\xa9 2022 GitHub, Inc.

Romantic partners, parents, children\xe2\x80\x94all these come first.This is true in life, and in science, where relationship research tends to focus on couples and families. When Emily Langan, an associate communication professor at Wheaton College, goes to conferences for the International Association of Relationship Researchers, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cfriendship is the smallest cluster there. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s a panel, if that.\xe2\x80\x9dFriendships are unique relationships because unlike family relationships, we choose to enter into them. And unlike other voluntary bonds, such as marriages and romantic relationships, they lack a formal structure. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go months without speaking with or seeing your significant other (hopefully), but you might go that long without contacting a friend.Still, survey upon survey upon survey shows how important people\xe2\x80\x99s friends are to their happiness. And though friendships tend to change as people age, there is some consistency in what people want from them.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to someone as young as 14 and someone as old as 100 talk about their close friends, and [there are] three expectations of a close friend that I hear people describing and valuing across the entire life course,\xe2\x80\x9d says William Rawlins, the Stocker Professor of Interpersonal Communication at Ohio University. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody to talk to, someone to depend on, and someone to enjoy. These expectations remain the same, but the circumstances under which they\xe2\x80\x99re accomplished change.\xe2\x80\x9dThe voluntary nature of friendship makes it subject to life\xe2\x80\x99s whims in a way that more formal relationships aren\xe2\x80\x99t. In adulthood, as people grow up and go away, friendships are the relationships most likely to take a hit. You\xe2\x80\x99re stuck with your family, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll prioritize your spouse. But where once you could run over to Jonny\xe2\x80\x99s house at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice and see if he could come out to play, now you have to ask Jonny if he has a couple hours to get a drink in two weeks.The voluntary nature of friendship makes it subject to life\xe2\x80\x99s whims in a way other relationships aren\xe2\x80\x99t.The beautiful, special thing about friendship, that friends are friends because they want to be, that they choose each other, is \xe2\x80\x9ca double agent,\xe2\x80\x9d Langan says, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I can choose to get in, and I can choose to get out.\xe2\x80\x9dThroughout life, from grade school to the retirement home, friendship continues to confer health benefits, both mental and physical. But as life accelerates, people\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and responsibilities shift, and friendships are affected, for better or, often, sadly, for worse.* * *The saga of adult friendship starts off well enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI think young adulthood is the golden age for forming friendships,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially for people who have the privilege and the blessing of being able to go to college.\xe2\x80\x9dDuring young adulthood, friendships become more complex and meaningful. In childhood, friends are mostly other kids who are fun to play with; in adolescence, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more self-disclosure and support between friends, but adolescents are still discovering their identity, and learning what it means to be intimate. Their friendships help them do that.But \xe2\x80\x9cin adolescence, people have a really tractable self,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll change.\xe2\x80\x9d How many band T-shirts from Hot Topic end up sadly crumpled at the bottom of dresser drawers because the owners\xe2\x80\x99 friends said the band was lame? The world may never know. By young adulthood, people are usually a little more secure in themselves, more likely to seek out friends who share their values on the important things, and let the little things be.To go along with their newly sophisticated approach to friendship, young adults also have time to devote to their friends. According to the Encyclopedia of Human Relationships, many young adults spend 10 to 25 hours a week with friends, and the 2014 American Time Use Survey found that people ages 20 to 24 spent the most time per day socializing on average of any age group.Recommended ReadingPlaying House: Finally, a TV Show Gets Female Friendships RightJulie BeckWhat It\xe2\x80\x99s Like to Get Worse at SomethingOlga KhazanAmerican Trees Are Moving West, and No One Knows WhyRobinson MeyerCollege is an environment that facilitates this, with keggers and close quarters, but even young adults who don\xe2\x80\x99t go to college are less likely to have some of the responsibilities that can take away from time with friends, such as marriage, or caring for children or older parents.Friendship networks are naturally denser, too, in youth, when most of the people you meet go to your school or live in your town. As people move for school, work, and family, networks spread out. Moving out of town for college gives some people their first taste of this distancing. In a longitudinal study that followed pairs of best friends over 19 years, a team led by Andrew Ledbetter, an associate communications-studies professor at Texas Christian University, found that participants had moved an average of 5.8 times during that period.\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of a part of life in the very mobile and high-level transportation- and communication-technology society that we have,\xe2\x80\x9d Ledbetter says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t think about how that\xe2\x80\x99s damaging the social fabric of our lives.\xe2\x80\x9dWe aren\xe2\x80\x99t obligated to our friends the way we are to our romantic partners, our jobs, and our families. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be sad to go, but go we will. This is one of the inherent tensions of friendships, which Rawlins calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe freedom to be independent and the freedom to be dependent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you situated?\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins asks me, in the course of explaining this tension. \xe2\x80\x9cWashington, D.C.,\xe2\x80\x9d I tell him.\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99d you go to college?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cChicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, so you\xe2\x80\x99re in Chicago, and you have close friends there. You say \xe2\x80\x98Ah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got this great opportunity in Washington \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 and [your friend] goes, \xe2\x80\x98Julie, you gotta take that!\xe2\x80\x99 [She\xe2\x80\x99s] essentially saying, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re free to go. Go there, do that, but if you need me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9dI wish he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use me as an example. It makes me sad.* * *As people enter middle age, they tend to have more demands on their time, many of them more pressing than friendship. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to put off catching up with a friend than it is to skip your kid\xe2\x80\x99s play or an important business trip. The ideal of people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations for friendship is always in tension with the reality of their lives, Rawlins says.\xe2\x80\x9cThe real bittersweet aspect is young adulthood begins with all this time for friendship, and friendship just having this exuberant, profound importance for figuring out who you are and what\xe2\x80\x99s next,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you find at the end of young adulthood, now you don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for the very people who helped you make all these decisions.\xe2\x80\x9dThe time is poured, largely, into jobs and families. Not everyone gets married or has kids, of course, but even those who stay single are likely to see their friendships affected by others\xe2\x80\x99 couplings. \xe2\x80\x9cThe largest drop-off in friends in the life course occurs when people get married,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of ironic, because at the [wedding], people invite both of their sets of friends, so it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of this last wonderful and dramatic gathering of both people\xe2\x80\x99s friends, but then it drops off.\xe2\x80\x9dIn a set of interviews he did in 1994 with middle-aged Americans about their friendships, Rawlins wrote that \xe2\x80\x9can almost tangible irony permeated these [adults\xe2\x80\x99] discussions of close or \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99 friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d They defined friendship as \xe2\x80\x9cbeing there\xe2\x80\x9d for one another, but reported that they rarely had time to spend with their most valued friends, whether because of circumstances, or the age-old problem of good intentions and bad follow-through: \xe2\x80\x9cFriends who lived within striking distance of each other found that \xe2\x80\xa6 scheduling opportunities to spend or share some time together was essential,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins writes. \xe2\x80\x9cSeveral mentioned, however, that these occasions often were talked about more than they were accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9dAs they move through life, people make and keep friends in different ways. Some are independent, make friends wherever they go, and may have more friendly acquaintances than deep friendships. Others are discerning, meaning they have a few best friends they stay close with over the years, but the deep investment means that the loss of one of those friends would be devastating. The most flexible are the acquisitive\xe2\x80\x94people who stay in touch with old friends, but continue to make new ones as they move through the world.Rawlins says that any new friends people might make in middle age are likely to be grafted onto other kinds of relationships\xe2\x80\x94as with co-workers, or parents of their children\xe2\x80\x99s friends\xe2\x80\x94because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for time-strapped adults to make friends when they already have an excuse to spend time together. As a result, the \xe2\x80\x9cmaking friends\xe2\x80\x9d skill can atrophy. \xe2\x80\x9c[In a study we did,] we asked people to tell us the story of the last person they became friends with, how they transitioned from acquaintance to friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Langan says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was interesting that people kind of struggled.\xe2\x80\x9d* * *But if you plot busyness across the life course, it makes a parabola. The tasks that take up our time taper in old age. Once people retire and their kids have grown up, there seems to be more time for the shared-living kind of friendship again. People tend to reconnect with old friends whom they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost touch with. And it seems more urgent to spend time with them\xe2\x80\x94according to socio-emotional selectivity theory, toward the end of life, people begin prioritizing experiences that will make them happiest in the moment, including spending time with close friends and family.And some people do manage to stay friends for life, or at least for a sizable chunk of life. But what predicts who will last through the maelstrom of middle age and be there for the silver age of friendship?Whether people hold onto their old friends or grow apart seems to come down to dedication and communication. In Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s longitudinal study of best friends, the number of months that friends reported being close in 1983 predicted whether they were still close in 2002, suggesting that the more you\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in a friendship already, the more likely you are to keep it going. Other research has found that people need to feel like they are getting as much out of the friendship as they are putting in, and that that equity can predict a friendship\xe2\x80\x99s continued success.Hanging out with a set of lifelong best friends can be annoying, because the years of inside jokes and references often make their communication unintelligible to outsiders. But this sort of shared language is part of what makes friendships last. In the longitudinal study, the researchers were also able to predict friends\xe2\x80\x99 future closeness by how well they performed on a word-guessing game in 1983. (The game was similar to Taboo, in that one partner gave clues about a word without actually saying it, while the other guessed.)\xe2\x80\x9cSuch communication skill and mutual understanding may help friends successfully transition through life changes that threaten friendship stability,\xe2\x80\x9d the study reads. Friends don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to communicate often, or intricately, just similarly.Of course, people can communicate with friends in more ways than ever, and media multiplexity theory suggests that the more platforms through which friends communicate\xe2\x80\x94texting and emailing, sending each other funny Snapchats and links on Facebook, and seeing each other in person\xe2\x80\x94the stronger their friendship is. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we only have the Facebook tie, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a friendship that\xe2\x80\x99s in greater jeopardy of not surviving into the future,\xe2\x80\x9d Ledbetter says.Though you would think we would all know better by now than to draw a hard line between online relationships and \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d relationships, Langan says her students still use \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cin-person.\xe2\x80\x9dThere are four main levels of maintaining a relationship, and digital communication works better for some than for others. The first is just keeping a relationship alive at all, just to keep it in existence. Saying \xe2\x80\x9cHappy birthday\xe2\x80\x9d on Facebook, liking a friend\xe2\x80\x99s tweet\xe2\x80\x94these are the life-support machines of friendship. They keep it breathing, but mechanically.Next is keeping a relationship at a stable level of closeness. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you can do that online too,\xe2\x80\x9d Langan says. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the platforms are broad enough in terms of being able to write a message, being able to send some support comments if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes possible to repair a relationship online too (another maintenance level), depending on how badly it was broken\xe2\x80\x94getting back in touch with someone, or sending a heartfelt apology email.\xe2\x80\x9cBut then when you get to the next level, which is: Can I make it a satisfying relationship? That\xe2\x80\x99s I think where the line starts to break down,\xe2\x80\x9d Langan says. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause what happens often is people think of satisfying relationships as being more than an online presence.\xe2\x80\x9dSocial media makes it possible to maintain more friendships, but more shallowly. And it can also keep relationships on life support that would (and maybe should) otherwise have died out.\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Tommy, who I knew when I was 5, is still on my Facebook feed is bizarre to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Langan says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any connection to Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s current life, and going back 25 years ago, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Tommy would be a memory to me. Like, I seriously have not seen Tommy in 35 years. Why would I care that Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s son just got accepted to Notre Dame? Yay for him! He\xe2\x80\x99s relatively a stranger to me. But in the current era of mediated relationships, those relationships never have to time out.\xe2\x80\x9dBy middle age, people have likely accumulated many friends from different jobs, different cities, and different activities, who don\xe2\x80\x99t know one another at all. These friendships fall into three categories: active, dormant, and commemorative. Friendships are active if you are in touch regularly; you could call on them for emotional support and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be weird; if you pretty much know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with their lives at this moment. A dormant friendship has history; maybe you haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken in a while, but you still think of that person as a friend. You\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to hear from them, and if you were in their city, you\xe2\x80\x99d definitely meet up.A commemorative friend is not someone you expect to hear from, or see, maybe ever again. But they were important to you at an earlier time in your life, and you think of them fondly for that reason, and still consider them a friend.Facebook makes things weird by keeping these friends continually in your peripheral vision. It violates what I\xe2\x80\x99ll call the camp-friend rule of commemorative friendships: No matter how close you were with your best friend from summer camp, it is always awkward to try to stay in touch when school starts again. Because your camp self is not your school self, and it dilutes the magic of the memory a little to try to attempt a pale imitation of what you had.The same goes for friends you see only online. If you never see your friends in person, you\xe2\x80\x99re not really sharing experiences so much as just keeping each other updated on your separate lives. It becomes a relationship based on storytelling rather than shared living\xe2\x80\x94not bad, just not the same.* * *\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one thing I really want to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cFriendships are always susceptible to circumstances. If you think of all the things we have to do\xe2\x80\x94we have to work, we have to take care of our kids, or our parents\xe2\x80\x94friends choose to do things for each other, so we can put them off. They fall through the cracks.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter young adulthood, he says, the reasons that friends stop being friends are usually circumstantial\xe2\x80\x94due to things outside of the relationship itself. One of the findings from Langan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfriendship rules\xe2\x80\x9d study was that \xe2\x80\x9cadults feel the need to be more polite in their friendships,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like, in adulthood, we can demand very much of our friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfair; they\xe2\x80\x99ve got other stuff going on. So we stop expecting as much, which to me is kind of a sad thing, that we walk away from that.\xe2\x80\x9d For the sake of being polite.But the things that make friendship fragile also make it flexible. Rawlins\xe2\x80\x99s interviewees tended to think of their friendships as continuous, even if they went through long periods in which they were out of touch. This is a fairly sunny view\xe2\x80\x94you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t assume you were still on good terms with your parents if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard from them in months. But the default assumption with friends is that you\xe2\x80\x99re still friends.\xe2\x80\x9cThat is how friendships continue, because people are living up to each other\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. And if we have relaxed expectations for each other, or we\xe2\x80\x99ve even suspended expectations, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense in which we realize that,\xe2\x80\x9d Rawlins says. \xe2\x80\x9cA summer when you\xe2\x80\x99re 10, three months is one-thirtieth of your life. When you\xe2\x80\x99re 30, what is it? It feels like the blink of an eye.\xe2\x80\x9dPerhaps friends are more willing to forgive long lapses in communication because they\xe2\x80\x99re feeling life\xe2\x80\x99s velocity acutely too. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad, sure, that we stop relying on our friends as much when we grow up, but it allows for a different kind of relationship, based on a mutual understanding of each other\xe2\x80\x99s human limitations. It\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s real, as Rawlins might say. Friendship is a relationship with no strings attached except the ones you choose to tie, one that\xe2\x80\x99s just about being there, as best as you can.'"
21,Putting Z-Library on IPFS (annas-blog.org),"http://annas-blog.org/putting-5,998,794-books-on-ipfs.html",247,"b'Putting 5,998,794 books on IPFS Anna\'s Blog Putting 5,998,794 books on IPFS annas-blog.org, 2022-11-19 Z-Library has been taken down, and its founders arrested. For the uninitiated, a quick recap: Z-Library was a massive \xe2\x80\x9cshadow library\xe2\x80\x9d of books, similar to Sci-Hub or Library Genesis. They had taken the concept of a shadow library to the next level, with a great user interface, bulk uploading and deduplication systems, and all sorts of other features. They were thriving on donations, and were therefore able to hire a professional team to keep improving the site. Until it all came crashing down two weeks ago. Their domains were seized by the FBI, and the (alleged) founders were arrested in Argentina. The site continues to run on Tor (presumably maintained by their employees), but no one knows how sustainable that is. It was sad day for the free flow of information, knowledge, and culture. \xd0\x90\xd0\xbd\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd \xd0\x9d\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 and \xd0\x92\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f \xd0\x95\xd1\x80\xd0\xbc\xd0\xb0\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb0 \xe2\x80\x94 we stand with you. Much love to you and your families, and thank you for what you have done for the world. Just a few months ago, we released our second backup of Z-Library \xe2\x80\x94 for about 31TB in total. This turned out to be timely. We also already had started working on a search aggregator for shadow libraries: \xe2\x80\x9cAnna\xe2\x80\x99s Archive\xe2\x80\x9d (not linking here, but you can Google it). With Z-Library down, we scrambled to get this running as soon as possible, and we did a soft-launch shortly thereafter. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out what is next. This seems the right time to step up and help shape the next chapter of shadow libraries. One such thing is to put the books up on IPFS. Some of the Library Genesis mirrors have already done this a few years ago for their books, and it makes access to their collection more resiliant. After all, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to host any files themselves over HTTP anymore, but can instead link to one of the many IPFS Gateways, which will happily proxy the books from one of the many volunteer-run machines (this is the big advantage IPFS has over BitTorrent). These machines can be hidden behind VPNs, or run on seedboxes paid for using crypto, similar to torrents. You can even get other people\xe2\x80\x99s machines to host the data, by paying for that service using Filecoin. However, putting dozens of terabytes of data on IPFS is no joke. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t fully succeeded in this project yet, so today we\xe2\x80\x99ll share where we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten so far. If you have experience pushing the limits of IPFS (or other systems, for that matter), and want to help our cause, please reach out on Reddit or Twitter. File organization When we released our first backup, we used torrents that contained tons of individual files. This turns out not to be great for two reasons: 1. torrent clients struggle with this many files (especially when trying to display them in a UI) 2. magnetic hard drives and filesystems struggle as well. You can get a lot of fragmentation and seeking back and forth. For our second release, we learned from this, and packaged the files in large \xe2\x80\x9c.tar\xe2\x80\x9d files. This solves these problems, but creates a new one: how do we now serve individual files on IPFS? We could simply extract the tar files, but then if you want to both seed the torrents, and seed the IPFS files, you need twice as much space: 62TB instead of 31TB (which was already pushing it). Luckily, there is a good solution for this: mounting the tar files using ratarmount. This creates a virtual filesystem using FUSE. Typically we run it like this: sudo ratarmount --fuse ""allow_other"" zlib2-data/*.tar zlib2/ In order to figure out which file is located where, ratarmount creates index files which it places next to the tar files. It takes some time to do this when you run it for the first time, so at some point we will share these index files on our torrent page, for your convenience. Root CIDs The second problem we ran into, was performance issues with IPFS. The most noticeable of these is the \xe2\x80\x9cadvertising\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproviding\xe2\x80\x9d phase, where your IPFS node tells the rest of the IPFS network what data you have. A single file typically gets split up in 256KiB chunks, each of which gets an identifier, called a \xe2\x80\x9cContent Identifier\xe2\x80\x9d, or \xe2\x80\x9cCID\xe2\x80\x9d. The file itself also gets a CID, which refers to a list of the child CIDs. All in all, a single file can easily have several, if not hundreds of these CIDs \xe2\x80\x94 and we have millions of files. All of these CIDs have to be advertised on the network! We first thought that we could solve this by using a particular feature of the \xe2\x80\x9cproviding\xe2\x80\x9d algorithm: only advertising the root CIDs of directories. The idea was that we could take the different directories that our files were already organized in, and advertise just the CID of that directory, and then address them using: /ipfs<directory CID>/<filename> Initially this seemed to work, but we ran into issues requesting more than one or a few files at once. It took us several days to debug this, but eventually it seems like we found the root cause, and filed a bug report. Sadly, this looks like a deep, fundamental issue, which we cannot easily work around. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to deal with lots of CIDs, at least for now. Sharding One mitigation is to use a larger chunk size. Instead of 256KiB, we can use 1MiB (the current maximum), by using --chunker=size-1048576 on add. Another thing that helps, is using the AcceleratedDHTClient, which batches multiple advertising calls to the same node. Still, various operations can take a long time, from \xe2\x80\x9cproviding\xe2\x80\x9d, to just getting some stats on the repo. This is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing with sharding the data across multiple IPFS nodes, even on the same machine. We started with 32 nodes, but there the per-node overhead seemed to get quite big, especially in terms of memory usage. But providing became quite fast: about 5 minutes per node, where each node had about 1 million CIDs to advertise. We are now playing with different numbers, to see what is optimal. Unfortunately IPFS doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let you easily merge or split nodes, so this is quite time-consuming. This is what our docker-compose.yml looks like, for example, with a single node (other nodes omitted for brevity): x-ipfs: &default-ipfs image: ipfs/kubo:v0.16.0 restart: unless-stopped environment: - IPFS_PATH=/data/ipfs - IPFS_PROFILE=server command: daemon --migrate=true --agent-version-suffix=docker --routing=dhtclient services: ipfs-zlib2-0: < In the container-init.d/ folder that is referred there, we have a single shell script, with the following content: #!/bin/sh ipfs config --json Experimental.FilestoreEnabled true ipfs config --json Experimental.AcceleratedDHTClient true We also manually changed the config for each node to use a unique IP address. Processing CIDs Once you have a bunch of nodes running, you can add data to it. In the example configuration above, we would run: docker-compose exec ipfs-zlib2-0 ipfs add --progress=false --nocopy --recursive --hash=blake2b-256 --chunker=size-1048576 /data/files > ipfs-zlib2-0.log This logs the filenames and CIDs to ipfs-zlib2-0.log. Now we can scoop up all the different log files into a CSV, using a little Python script: import glob def process_line(line, csv): components = line.split() if len(components) == 3 and components[0] == ""added"": file_components = components[2].split(""/"") if len(file_components) == 3 and file_components[0] == ""files"": csv.write(file_components[2] + "","" + components[1] + ""\\n"") with open(""ipfs.csv"", ""w"") as csv: for file in glob.glob(""*.log""): print(""Processing"", file) with open(file) as f: for line in f: process_line(line, csv) Because the filenames are simply the Z-Library IDs, the CSV looks something like this: 1,bafk2bzacedrabzierer44yu5bm7faovf5s4z2vpa3ry2cx6bjrhbjenpxifio 2,bafk2bzaceckyxepao7qbhlohijcqgzt4d2lfcgecetfjd6fhzvuprqgwgnygs 3,bafk2bzacec3yohzdu5rfebtrhyyvqifib5rxadtu35vvcca5a3j6yaeds3yfy 4,bafk2bzaceacs3a4t6kfbjjpkgx562qeqzhkbslpdk7hmv5qozarqn2jid5sfg 5,bafk2bzaceac2kybzpe6esch3auugpi2zoo2yodm5bx7ddwfluomt2qd3n6kbg 6,bafk2bzacealxowh6nddsktetuixn2swkydjuehsw6chk2qyke4x2pxltp7slw Most systems support reading CSV. For example, in Mysql you could write: CREATE TABLE zlib_ipfs ( zlibrary_id INT NOT NULL, ipfs_cid CHAR(62) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(zlibrary_id) ); LOAD DATA INFILE \'/var/lib/mysql/ipfs.csv\' INTO TABLE zlib_ipfs FIELDS TERMINATED BY \',\'; This data should be exactly the same for everyone, as long as you run ipfs add with the same parameters as we did. For your convenience, we will also release our CSV at some point, so you can link to our files on IPFS without doing all the hashing yourself. Remote file storage One thing you learn quickly when hosting ~controversial~ content, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite useful to have long-term \xe2\x80\x9cbackend\xe2\x80\x9d servers, which you don\xe2\x80\x99t expose on the public internet, and publicly facing \xe2\x80\x9cfrontend\xe2\x80\x9d servers, which are more at risk of being taken down. For serving websites, the \xe2\x80\x9cfrontend\xe2\x80\x9d server can be a simple proxy (HTTP proxy like Varnish, VPN node like Wireguard, etc). But with IPFS, the better solution might be to actually run IPFS on the frontend server directly. This has several advantages: Traffic speed and latency are better without a proxy. You can get a storage backend server with lots of hard drives and weak cpu/memory, and the inverse for the frontend server. You can shard across multiple physical IPFS servers, without having to move tons of data around all the time. For this, we use remote mounted filesystems. The easiest way to set that up seemed to be rclone: # File server: rclone -vP serve sftp --addr :1234 --user hello --pass hello ./zlib1 # IPFS machine: sudo rclone mount -v --sftp-host *redacted* --sftp-port 1234 --sftp-user hello --sftp-pass `rclone obscure hello` --sftp-set-modtime=false --read-only --vfs-cache-mode full --attr-timeout 100000h --dir-cache-time 100000h --vfs-cache-max-age 100000h --vfs-cache-max-size 300G --no-modtime --transfers 6 --cache-dir ./zlib1cache --allow-other :sftp:/zlib1 ./zlib1 We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure if this is the best way to do this, so if you have tips for how to most efficiently set up a remote immutable file system with good local caching, let us know. Final thoughts We\xe2\x80\x99re still figuring all of this out, and don\xe2\x80\x99t have it all running quite yet, so if you have experience with this, please contact us. We\xe2\x80\x99re also interested in learning from people who have set up IPFS Collaborative Clusters, so more people can easily participate in hosting these books. We\xe2\x80\x99re also always looking for volunteers to run IPFS and torrent nodes, help build new projects, and so on (we noticed that lots of technical talent just left a certain social media company \xe2\x80\x94 and who particularly care about the free flow of information.. hi!). If you believe in preserving humanity\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and culture, please consider supporting us. I have personally been working on this full time, mostly self-funded, plus a couple of large generous donations. But to make this work sustainable, we would probably need to set up a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cshadow Patreon\xe2\x80\x9d.

Say hello to ronnagrams and quettameters: International scientists gathered in France voted on Friday for new metric prefixes to express the world\'s largest and smallest measurements, prompted by an ever-growing amount of data. It marks the first time in more than three decades that new prefixes have been added to the International System of Units (SI), the agreed global standard for the metric system. Joining the ranks of well-known prefixes like kilo and milli are ronna and quetta for the largest numbers\xe2\x80\x94and ronto and quecto for the smallest. The change was voted on by scientists and government representatives from across the world attending the 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures, which governs the SI and meets roughly every four years at Versailles Palace, west of Paris. The UK\'s National Physical Laboratory, which led the push for the new prefixes, confirmed that the resolution had passed in a statement. The prefixes make it easier to express large amounts\xe2\x80\x94for example, always referring to a kilometer as 1,000 meters or a millimeter as one thousandth of a meter would quickly become cumbersome. Since the SI was established in 1960, scientific need has led to a growing number of prefixes. The last time was in 1991, when chemists wanting to express vast molecular quantities spurred the addition of zetta and yotta. A yottameter is a one followed by 24 zeroes. But even the mighty yotta is not enough to handle the world\'s voracious appetite for data, according to Richard Brown, the head of metrology at the UK\'s National Physical Laboratory. ""In terms of expressing data in yottabytes, which is the highest prefix currently, we\'re very close to the limit,"" Brown told AFP. ""At the bottom end, it makes sense to have a symmetrical expansion, which is useful for quantum science, particle physics\xe2\x80\x94when you\'re measuring really, really small things."" New weight of the world The new prefixes can simplify how we talk about some pretty big objects. ""If we think about mass, instead of distance, the Earth weighs approximately six ronnagrams,"" which is a six followed by 27 zeroes, Brown said. ""Jupiter, that\'s about two quettagrams,"" he added\xe2\x80\x94a two followed by 30 zeros. Brown said he had the idea for the update when he saw media reports using unsanctioned prefixes for data storage such as brontobytes and hellabytes. Google in particular has been using hella for bytes since 2010. ""Those were terms that were unofficially in circulation, so it was clear that the SI had to do something,"" he said. However metric prefixes need to be shortened to just their first letter\xe2\x80\x94and B and H were already taken, ruling out bronto and hella. ""The only letters that were not used for other units or other symbols were R and Q,"" Brown said. Convention dictates that the larger prefixes end in an A, and the smaller ones in an O. And ""the middle of the words are very, very loosely based on the Greek and Latin for nine and 10,"" Brown said. The new prefixes should ""future proof the system"" and satisfy the world\'s need for higher numbers\xe2\x80\x94at least for the next 20 to 25 years, he added. \xc2\xa9 2022 AFP Citation: Earth now weighs six ronnagrams: New metric prefixes voted in (2022, November 18) retrieved 19 November 2022 from https://phys.org/news/2022-11-earth-ronnagrams-metric-prefixes-voted.html This document is subject to copyright.

Domains that are not used for email may be parked domains, legacy domains, testing domains, black-hole domains, or any other domain that may be used for applications other than email. It is also possible that a domain accepts inbound email, but does not send email, or vise versa. In this article we\'ll explain: How a domain can be set up with DMARC so that no email can be sent on behalf of the domain. This helps prevent fraudulent activities that may affect the reputation of the domain and brand. Using rfc7505 \'null MX\' records as a best practice for domains that do not accept inbound email. This improves the experience of the customer when accidentally sending email to the domain. We\'ll also explain how these techniques can be used selectively to include, or exclude selected subdomains. Outbound email Domains that are not used to send email may still be susceptible to fraudulent abuse. An adversary may try to send email on behalf of the domain. That is: using the domain in the sender address. Proper hardening can prevent this. The goal here is to leverage DMARC to prevent any email sent on behalf of the domain from being accepted by any receiver. We achieve this by configuring the domain so that it is no longer possible for any email to reach DMARC alignment, thus forcing the receiver to follow the DMARC policy, which we will set to \'reject\'. By publishing the \'reject\' policy, any email that is attempted to be sent on behalf of the domain will be rejected by (DMARC capable) receivers. Remember that for an email to be considered DMARC aligned, at least one of DKIM and SPF must reach alignment. So, in order to prevent any email from reaching DMARC alignment, neither SPF nor DKIM may reach alignment. SPF To prevent any sender from reaching SPF alignment for a domain, we create an SPF DNS record with just one rule: -all. As the name implies, the all mechanism matches every sender, thus every email. By prefixing the rule with the - (fail) policy, each email sent on behalf of the domain will fail SPF validation, thus failing SPF alignment. To prevent any sender from reaching SPF alignment, a TXT record should be created at the domain apex with the following value: v=spf1 -all If the domain already has an (old) SPF record set, then that existing SPF record should be replaced with the one displayed above, since a domain should only have 1 SPF record. Be aware that SPF does not propagate, meaning that for email sent from subdomain.yourdomain.com, the SPF record at the domain apex will not be used. So, it is recommended to also create this same SPF record for all subdomains, by creating a wildcard DNS record at *.yourdomain.com. Note: an alternative option would be not to publish an SPF record at all. This is the same as publishing a ?all rule. The ? (neutral) policy means SPF is not to be used during evaluation of email by the receiver. It is effectively an opt-out from using SPF. However, how a \'neutral\' policy is handled differs with the various SMTP software implementations, so the email may still be accepted by some if a neutral policy (or no SPF record at all) is used. It is therefore recommended to use SPF with the -all rule to give a strong statement to receivers that email should not be accepted. DKIM The goal is that no sender can ever reach DMARC alignment, which means that no sender should ever be able to reach DKIM alignment. This is achieved by simply removing any existing DKIM DNS records. That are any TXT records at *._domainkey.yourdomain.com, or DKIM records published for subdomains at *._domainkey.subdomain.yourdomain.com. Be aware that the v=DKIM1; part in a DKIM record is actually optional, so even if a TXT record does not start with \'v=DKIM1\', it may actually be a valid DKIM record. However, since no TXT type records other than DKIM records should be published under the _domainkey label anyway, you probably want to remove all TXT records published under the _domainkey label as part of good hygiene. DMARC With the SPF policy set to -all and any DKIM records removed, it will no longer be possible for any email that is sent on behalf of the domain to achieve DMARC alignment. As a result, a DMARC capable receiver will apply the DMARC policy that is published in the DMARC DNS record. By creating a DMARC record with the reject policy, any email sent on behalf of the domain should be rejected by the receiver. Create a DNS TXT type record at _dmarc.yourdomain.com with the following content: v=DMARC1; p=reject; Note that a domain should only have one DMARC record (a TXT type record starting with v=DMARC1, at _dmarc.yourdomain.com ). If the domain already has a DMARC record, the existing record can be re-used by setting the p value to reject. If there is an existing DMARC record with the sp value set, remove that so that the reject policy will also apply to subdomains. This DMARC record advises any receiver that email from the domain should be rejected if the email does not reach DMARC alignment. Since we ensured that no email can ever reach SPF or DKIM alignment, it is ensured that no email can ever be DMARC aligned. Therefore, any email sent on behalf of the domain should be rejected by the receiver. Note: Unlike, for example with SPF, DMARC does propagate. This means that if an email is sent using subdomain.yourdomain.com in the sender address, and no DMARC record exists at _dmarc.subdomain.yourdomain.com, the receiver will look for a DMARC record at _dmarc.yourdomain.com. So, verify that no other DMARC records exist at subdomains, to ensure that no email can be sent from any subdomains. With the SPF, DKIM and DMARC set up as explained above, it should no longer be possible for any sender to send email on behalf of the domain (using the domain in the sender address). Inbound email Inbound email is email that is being delivered to a domain. Not every domain is intended to accept inbound email, even if the domain is used for outbound (sending) email. But even if a domain is not intended to accept inbound email, senders may still attempt to deliver email. This will obviously fail, but due to resend policies it may take up to a week before the user is notified that the email is undeliverable. By properly configuring the domain, we can indicate a \'positive denial\' to potential senders that the domain does not accept inbound email. This gives a better experience to the end user, as they will get an immediate response that the email cannot be delivered to the domain. There is a lesser known \'feature\' in rfc5321 section 5.1, which describes how a sending SMTP service must locate the host to deliver email to. If a domain has no MX records, the sending SMTP server must attempt to deliver email on the host found in the DNS A (or AAAA) records. Yes, you read that right. Even if a domain has no MX type records set up, delivery of email will still be attempted at the host pointed to by the A or AAAA records. The reason for this behavior is to provide a fallback method in case of DNS misconfiguration, or if the DNS service does not support the MX type record (which, in 1982 when the original RFC for SMTP was released, was a concern). So, not having any MX type records set for a domain, will cause two different issues: The sending SMTP service will retry delivery of an email message for an extended period (often up to a week). This results in the user not being notified on the delivery issue until the retry timeouts have passed. It causes undesired connection attempts to the hosts configured in the A/AAAA records on port 25. To solve these issues, a \'null MX\' record is proposed in rfc7505. \'null MX\' records (rfc7505) The rfc7505 standard describes a method of \'positive denial\' of inbound email. By placing a ""null MX"" record, a domain can indicate that it does not accept inbound email. This offers a better overall experience for the end user who is attempting to send the email, as delivery will fail immediately (instead of after a week or so). Properly designed email clients will be able to hint the user that the used domain in the recipient\'s address is likely mistyped. A rfc7505 \'null MX\' record is an MX record with the highest priority (0), and an empty host label ("".""). This \'null MX\' record should be the only MX type record for the (sub)domain. MX 0 . This will cause a sending SMTP service to use this record, and not fall back to the A/AAAA record. Since the hostname in the \'null MX\' record is not usable (it is empty), the sending SMTP service will not be able to use this record. Since there are no further MX records published by the domain, the SMTP service has no other delivery methods, and the email will hard-bounce. Properly designed SMTP services, and email agents (MUA) will be able to recognize the rfc7505 \'null MX\' record (one MX record, with prio 0 and an empty host name), and will notify the user attempting to send the email that the domain does not accept email, and even hint the user that they may have mistyped the domain name, like an email client may do for non-existing domains. Allowing (certain) subdomains Up till this point, this article assumed that the entire domain should no longer be usable for email. However, if certain subdomains are still to be used for email, you can override your policies for a subdomain. SPF We want to allow email from a subdomain to reach SPF alignment, while still preventing email from the domain apex or other subdomains to reach alignment. To achieve that, an SPF record can be created for the specific subdomain, or by creating an SPF record for a wildcard subdomain (which will then apply to all subdomains). The SPF record is then used to designate the allowed senders for this specific subdomain. The domain apex can still use the -all policy as explained above. DKIM DKIM DNS records may be created at the subdomain level (for example: selector._domainkey.subdomain.mailhardener.com). To ensure this key can only be used for the subdomain, it is recommended to set the \'strict\' flag in the DKIM DNS record, by adding t=s to the record. Using strict mode will prevent the key from being accepted for any other subdomains. DMARC Strictly speaking, DMARC does not have to be changed if a subdomain is allowed to send email. If the SPF and/or DKIM configuration for the subdomain is set up correctly, then email from the subdomain will achieve DMARC alignment, thus the DMARC policy is not applied, thus the email will be accepted. If needed, the DMARC policy for any (or all) subdomain(s) can be overridden by any of the following methods. Create a DMARC DNS record for the subdomain at _dmarc.subdomain.yourdomain.com, and set the p= to the desired policy for that specific subdomain. Or, set the sp= subdomain policy configuration in the domain apex DMARC record (at _dmarc.yourdomain.com), this policy will apply to all subdomains of yourdomain.com MX (inbound email) When a subdomain does accept inbound email (but the domain apex does not), then MX records can be created at the subdomain level. The domain apex, or other subdomains may still use the rfc7505 \'null MX\' record at the same time. Disallowing (certain) subdomains Conversely, it is also possible to disable email for a subdomain, while still retaining email functionality for the domain apex, or other subdomains. We apply the same techniques as described above, but in such a way that the domain apex, and/or other subdomains can still be used for email. SPF To prevent email from a subdomain from reaching SPF alignment, an SPF record can be created for the specific subdomain, or by creating an SPF record for a wildcard subdomain (which will then apply to all subdomains). This SPF record should then use the -all policy. Since SPF does not propagate, the domain apex (or any other subdomains) can still use permissive SPF records that designate permitted senders for that (sub)domain. DKIM To prevent email from a subdomain from reaching DKIM alignment (and thus DMARC alignment), the obvious first step is to remove any existing DKIM DNS records published under the subdomain. That is for example: all TXT records at *._domainkey.subdomain.mailhardener.com. However, additional steps must be taken to prevent the subdomain from using any other DKIM records (from the domain apex, or other subdomains). By default, the used DKIM record does not have to be published under the exact subdomain. For example: it is possible for email from jane@subdomain.mailhardener.com to use a DKIM key from mailhardener.com. Therefore, we must augment the existing DKIM records that are published under the domain apex and other subdomains, with the \'strict\' flag. By adding t=s to the DKIM records, the DKIM record becomes \'strict\', meaning that the DKIM signature will only be accepted if the DKIM record is published under the exact same (sub)domain as is used in the domain portion of the sender email address (the part after the \'@\' symbol). DMARC When disallowing email from a subdomain, we want a strict DMARC policy for that subdomain. Other subdomains, or the domain apex may still use a less-strict (or even no) DMARC policy. If no DMARC policy is published for the subdomain, a receiver will propagate \'up\' to the domain apex looking for a DMARC policy. So, in case it is desired to have a DMARC policy for a subdomain that differs from other subdomains, or the domain apex, a DMARC policy record can be published at the subdomain level: _dmarc.[subdomain].example.com Re-enabling email functionality Re-enabling email functionality for a domain that was previously set up not to handle email, may actually be slightly simpler than hardening an existing domain, as there should not be any legacy to consider. It is like starting with a clean slate. SPF To re-enable email for the domain, add the sender (via for example an a, or include rule) to the existing SPF record. The -all that was placed earlier can remain in place, but the slightly less strict ~all (\'soft fail\') may be used during the initial setup period, to verify the SPF policy is correct and complete. It is recommended to use DMARC reporting to verify that all legitimate senders pass SPF alignment. DKIM To re-enable email for a (sub)domain, add the DKIM DNS records as recommended by the vendor of the email service or software used to send the email. It is recommended to use DMARC reporting to verify and monitor that all legitimate senders are passing DKIM alignment. DMARC If a DMARC record was created following the examples above, then it should already be set up to use a strong (reject) policy, and have DMARC reporting enabled. During the initial setup of the email services, it might be beneficial to set a less strict policy (for example: quarantine, or even none), and use DMARC monitoring to verify the email services are aligned before switching back to the strong policy (reject). Because the domain is starting from a \'clean slate\' again, it is a great opportunity to use the strong reject policy, and ensure that all senders are (at least) reaching DKIM alignment. Always be monitoring Monitoring outbound email Regardless if a (sub)domain is used for outbound (sending) email or not, it is always recommended to use rfc7489 DMARC monitoring. A DMARC report aggregation service such as Mailhardener can be used to create an overview of all sources of email. Even if a (sub)domain is not used for outbound email, DMARC reports can still be used to verify that no email service is reaching alignment. It can also be used for digital forensics, fraud investigations and detecting suspicious activity of an adversary. If a (sub)domain is used for outbound email, then DMARC reports are used to verify that all legitimate senders are reaching DKIM and/or SPF alignment. This helps improve deliverability, and allows for adopting a strong (reject) DMARC policy, which reduces fraudulent use of the domain in email. Monitoring inbound email Regardless if a domain accepts inbound email, it is always recommended to use rfc8460 SMTP TLS reporting. SMTP TLS reports are used to monitor inbound email traffic from the sender\'s perspective, mostly (but not exclusively) related to TLS (SSL) aspects of the SMTP session. For (sub)domains that do not accept inbound email, SMTP TLS reporting can be used to verify that no SMTP session is ever successful for the monitored (sub)domain. Conversely, for (sub)domains that do accept inbound email, SMTP TLS reports are used to verify that senders are not experiencing TLS (SSL) related delivery issues. Conclusion Proper implementation of email hardening techniques can be beneficial even to (sub)domains that are not intended to be used with email. These may be parked domains, legacy domains, testing domains, or any other domain that are used for other services than email. Deploying a strict DMARC policy, whilst ensuring that email sent on behalf of the (sub)domain can never reach alignment, is an effective anti-fraud mechanism that helps maintain the reputation of the domain and brand. By using a \'null MX\' setup as defined by rfc7505, a better user-experience is created for customers that may be accidentally attempting to send email to a domain that is not intended to receive email. Regardless if the domain is intended to be used for email or not, it is always recommended to use DMARC monitoring for outbound email, and SMTP TLS report monitoring for inbound email. It is recommended to use an email monitoring suite, such as Mailhardener, to monitor domain assets from being abused.

25,Improving code review time (fb.com),https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/16/culture/meta-code-review-time-improving/,213,"b'Move faster, wait less: Improving code review time at Meta Skip to content Search this site Open Source Open Source Meta Open Source Platforms Android iOS Web Infrastructure Systems Core Data Data Infrastructure DevInfra Production Engineering Security Research Publications Physical Infrastructure Connectivity Data Center Engineering Networking & Traffic Research Publications Video Engineering & AR/VR Video Engineering Virtual Reality Research Publications Artificial Intelligence ML Applications AI Research Research Publications Watch Videos POSTED ON NOVEMBER 16, 2022 TO Culture, DevInfra, Open Source Move faster, wait less: Improving code review time at Meta By Patrick Riggs Code reviews are one of the most important parts of the software development process At Meta we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized the need to make code reviews as fast as possible without sacrificing quality We\xe2\x80\x99re sharing several tools and steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken at Meta to reduce the time waiting for code reviews When done well, code reviews can catch bugs, teach best practices, and ensure high code quality. At Meta we call an individual set of changes made to the codebase a \xe2\x80\x9cdiff.\xe2\x80\x9d While we like to move fast at Meta, every diff must be reviewed, without exception. But, as the Code Review team, we also understand that when reviews take longer, people get less done. We\xe2\x80\x99ve studied several metrics to learn more about code review bottlenecks that lead to unhappy developers and used that knowledge to build features that help speed up the code review process without sacrificing review quality. We\xe2\x80\x99ve found a correlation between slow diff review times (P75) and engineer dissatisfaction. Our tools to surface diffs to the right reviewers at key moments in the code review lifecycle have significantly improved the diff review experience. What makes a diff review feel slow? To answer this question we started by looking at our data. We track a metric that we call \xe2\x80\x9cTime In Review,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a measure of how long a diff is waiting on review across all of its individual review cycles. We only account for the time when the diff is waiting on reviewer action. Time In Review is calculated as the sum of the time spent in blue sections. What we discovered surprised us. When we looked at the data in early 2021, our median (P50) hours in review for a diff was only a few hours, which we felt was pretty good. However, looking at P75 (i.e., the slowest 25 percent of reviews) we saw diff review time increase by as much as a day. We analyzed the correlation between Time In Review and user satisfaction (as measured by a company-wide survey). The results were clear: The longer someone\xe2\x80\x99s slowest 25 percent of diffs take to review, the less satisfied they were by their code review process. We now had our north star metric: P75 Time In Review. Driving down Time In Review would not only make people more satisfied with their code review process, it would also increase the productivity of every engineer at Meta. Driving down Time to Review for our diffs means our engineers are spending significantly less time on reviews \xe2\x80\x93 making them more productive and more satisfied with the overall review process. Balancing speed with quality However, simply optimizing for the speed of review could lead to negative side effects, like encouraging rubber-stamp reviewing. We needed a guardrail metric to protect against negative unintended consequences. We settled on \xe2\x80\x9cEyeball Time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the total amount of time reviewers spent looking at a diff. An increase in rubber-stamping would lead to a decrease in Eyeball Time. Now we have established our goal metric, Time In Review, and our guardrail metric, Eyeball Time. What comes next? Build, experiment, and iterate Nearly every product team at Meta uses experimental and data-driven processes to release and iterate on features. However, this process is still very new to internal tools teams like ours. There are\xc2\xa0 a number of challenges (sample size, randomization, network effect) that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to overcome that product teams do not have. We address these challenges with new data foundations for running network experiments and using techniques to reduce variance and increase sample size. This extra effort is worth it \xe2\x80\x94 by laying the foundation of an experiment, we can later prove the impact and the effectiveness of the features we\xe2\x80\x99re building. The experimental process: The selection of goal and guardrail metrics is driven by the hypothesis we hold for the feature. We built the foundations to easily choose different experiment units to randomize treatment, including randomization by user clusters. Next reviewable diff The inspiration for this feature came from an unlikely place \xe2\x80\x94 video streaming services. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to binge watch shows on certain streaming services because of how seamless the transition is from one episode to another. What if we could do that for code reviews? By queueing up diffs we could encourage a diff review flow state, allowing reviewers to make the most of their time and mental energy. And so Next Reviewable Diff was born. We use machine learning to identify a diff that the current reviewer is highly likely to want\xc2\xa0 to review. Then we surface that diff to the reviewer after they finish their current code review. We make it easy to cycle through possible next diffs and quickly remove themselves as a reviewer if a diff is not relevant to them. After its launch, we found that this feature resulted in a 17 percent overall increase in review actions per day (such as accepting a diff, commenting, etc.) and that engineers that use this flow perform 44 percent more review actions than the average reviewer! Improving reviewer recommendations The choice of reviewers that an author selects for a diff is very important. Diff authors want reviewers who are going to review their code well, quickly, and who are experts for the code their diff touches. Historically, Meta\xe2\x80\x99s reviewer recommender looked at a limited set of data to make recommendations, leading to problems with new files and staleness as engineers changed teams. We built a new reviewer recommendation system, incorporating work hours awareness and file ownership information. This allows reviewers that are available to review a diff and are more likely to be great reviewers to be prioritized. We rewrote the model that powers these recommendations to support backtesting and automatic retraining too. The result? A 1.5 percent increase in diffs reviewed within 24 hours and an increase in top three recommendation accuracy (how often the actual reviewer is one of the top three suggested) from below 60 percent to nearly 75 percent. As an added bonus, the new model was also 14 times faster (P90 latency)! Stale Diff Nudgebot We know that a small proportion of stale diffs can make engineers unhappy, even if their diffs are reviewed quickly otherwise.\xc2\xa0 Slow reviews have other effects too \xe2\x80\x94 the code itself becomes stale, authors have to context switch, and overall productivity drops. To directly address this, we built Nudgebot, which was inspired by research done at Microsoft. For diffs that were taking an extra long time to review, Nudgebot determines the subset of reviewers that are most likely to review the diff. Then it\xc2\xa0 sends them a chat ping with the appropriate context for the diff along with a set of quick actions that allow recipients to jump right into reviewing. Our experiment with Nudgebot had great results. The average Time In Review for all diffs dropped 7 percent (adjusted to exclude weekends) and the proportion of diffs that waited longer than three days for review dropped 12 percent! The success of this feature was individually published as well. This is what a chat notification about a set of stale diffs looks like to a reviewer, while showing one of the potential interactions of \xe2\x80\x9cRemind Me Later.\xe2\x80\x9d What comes next? Our current and future work is focused on questions like: What is the right set of people to be reviewing a given diff? How can we make it easier for reviewers to have the information they need to give a high quality review? How can we leverage AI and machine learning to improve the code review process? We\xe2\x80\x99re continually pursuing\xc2\xa0 answers to these questions, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to finding more ways to streamline developer processes in the future!

27,Researchers quietly cracked Zeppelin ransomware keys (krebsonsecurity.com),https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/researchers-quietly-cracked-zeppelin-ransomware-keys/,201,"b""Researchers Quietly Cracked Zeppelin Ransomware Keys \xe2\x80\x93 Krebs on Security Advertisement Advertisement Skip to content HomeAbout the Author Advertising/Speaking Researchers Quietly Cracked Zeppelin Ransomware Keys November 17, 2022 6 Comments Peter is an IT manager for a technology manufacturer that got hit with a Russian ransomware strain called \xe2\x80\x9cZeppelin\xe2\x80\x9d in May 2020. He\xe2\x80\x99d been on the job less than six months, and because of the way his predecessor architected things, the company\xe2\x80\x99s data backups also were encrypted by Zeppelin. After two weeks of stalling their extortionists, Peter\xe2\x80\x99s bosses were ready to capitulate and pay the ransom demand. Then came the unlikely call from an FBI agent. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pay,\xe2\x80\x9d the agent said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve found someone who can crack the encryption.\xe2\x80\x9d Peter, who spoke candidly about the attack on condition of anonymity, said the FBI told him to contact a cybersecurity consulting firm in New Jersey called Unit 221B, and specifically its founder \xe2\x80\x94 Lance James. Zeppelin sprang onto the crimeware scene in December 2019, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before James discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the malware\xe2\x80\x99s encryption routines that allowed him to brute-force the decryption keys in a matter of hours, using nearly 100 cloud computer servers. In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, James said Unit 221B was wary of advertising its ability to crack Zeppelin ransomware keys because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to tip its hand to Zeppelin\xe2\x80\x99s creators, who were likely to modify their file encryption approach if they detected it was somehow being bypassed. This is not an idle concern. There are multiple examples of ransomware groups doing just that after security researchers crowed about finding vulnerabilities in their ransomware code. \xe2\x80\x9cThe minute you announce you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a decryptor for some ransomware, they change up the code,\xe2\x80\x9d James said. But he said the Zeppelin group appears to have stopped spreading their ransomware code gradually over the past year, possibly because Unit 221B\xe2\x80\x99s referrals from the FBI let them quietly help nearly two dozen victim organizations recover without paying their extortionists. In a blog post published today to coincide with a Black Hat talk on their discoveries, James and co-author Joel Lathrop said they were motivated to crack Zeppelin after the ransomware gang started attacking nonprofit and charity organizations. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat motivated us the most during the leadup to our action was the targeting of homeless shelters, nonprofits and charity organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d the two wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThese senseless acts of targeting those who are unable to respond are the motivation for this research, analysis, tools, and blog post. A general Unit 221B rule of thumb around our offices is: Don\xe2\x80\x99t [REDACTED] with the homeless or sick! It will simply trigger our ADHD and we will get into that hyper-focus mode that is good if you\xe2\x80\x99re a good guy, but not so great if you are an ***hole.\xe2\x80\x9d The researchers said their break came when they understood that while Zeppelin used three different types of encryption keys to encrypt files, they could undo the whole scheme by factoring or computing just one of them: An ephemeral RSA-512 public key that is randomly generated on each machine it infects. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.\xe2\x80\x9d Unit 221B ultimately built a \xe2\x80\x9cLive CD\xe2\x80\x9d version of Linux that victims could run on infected systems to extract that RSA-512 key. From there, they would load the keys into a cluster of 800 CPUs donated by hosting giant Digital Ocean that would then start cracking them. The company also used that same donated infrastructure to help victims decrypt their data using the recovered keys. A typical Zeppelin ransomware note. Jon is another grateful Zeppelin ransomware victim who was aided by Unit 221B\xe2\x80\x99s decryption efforts. Like Peter, Jon asked that his last name and that of his employer be omitted from the story, but he\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of IT for a mid-sized managed service provider that got hit with Zeppelin in July 2020. The attackers that savaged Jon\xe2\x80\x99s company managed to phish credentials and a multi-factor authentication token for some tools the company used to support customers, and in short order they\xe2\x80\x99d seized control over the servers and backups for a healthcare provider customer. Jon said his company was reluctant to pay a ransom in part because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear from the hackers\xe2\x80\x99 demands whether the ransom amount they demanded would provide a key to unlock all systems, and that it would do so safely. \xe2\x80\x9cThey want you to unlock your data with their software, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t trust that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jon said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to use your own software or someone else who\xe2\x80\x99s trusted to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d In August 2022, the FBI and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a joint warning on Zeppelin, saying the FBI had \xe2\x80\x9cobserved instances where Zeppelin actors executed their malware multiple times within a victim\xe2\x80\x99s network, resulting in the creation of different IDs or file extensions, for each instance of an attack; this results in the victim needing several unique decryption keys.\xe2\x80\x9d The advisory says Zeppelin has attacked \xe2\x80\x9ca range of businesses and critical infrastructure organizations, including defense contractors, educational institutions, manufacturers, technology companies, and especially organizations in the healthcare and medical industries. Zeppelin actors have been known to request ransom payments in Bitcoin, with initial amounts ranging from several thousand dollars to over a million dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d The FBI and CISA say the Zeppelin actors gain access to victim networks by exploiting weak Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, exploiting SonicWall firewall vulnerabilities, and phishing campaigns. Prior to deploying Zeppelin ransomware, actors spend one to two weeks mapping or enumerating the victim network to identify data enclaves, including cloud storage and network backups, the alert notes. Jon said he felt so lucky after connecting with James and hearing about their decryption work, that he toyed with the idea of buying a lottery ticket that day. \xe2\x80\x9cThis just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Jon said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s 100 percent like winning the lottery.\xe2\x80\x9d By the time Jon\xe2\x80\x99s company got around to decrypting their data, they were forced by regulators to prove that no patient data had been exfiltrated from their systems. All told, it took his employer two months to fully recover from the attack. \xe2\x80\x9cI definitely feel like I was ill-prepared for this attack,\xe2\x80\x9d Jon said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from this is the importance of forming your core team and having those people who know what their roles and responsibilities are ahead of time. Also, trying to vet new vendors you\xe2\x80\x99ve never met before and build trust relationships with them is very difficult to do when you have customers down hard now and they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on you to help them get back up.\xe2\x80\x9d A more technical writeup on Unit 221B\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries (cheekily titled \xe2\x80\x9c0XDEAD ZEPPELIN\xe2\x80\x9d) is available here.

Ayahuasca The hallucinogenic beverage ayahuasca has been used for religious and medicinal purposes by Amazonian tribes for thousands of years. More recently, ayahuasca retreats and research projects \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0 exploring the beverage\xe2\x80\x99s potential effects on health, spirituality and personal growth \xe2\x80\x93 have seen its use expand globally. The hallucinogenic effects of ayahuascaAyahuasca is made by prolonged heating or boiling of the Banisteriopsis caapi stem with the leaves of the Psychotria viridis plant. B. caapi provides a source of harmine, which inhibits the breakdown of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) supplied by P. virdis, increasing the bioavailability of DMT in the body and resulting in the hallucinogenic side effects. At the University of Melbourne, Dr. Daniel Perkins is involved in a number of research projects surrounding medicinal psychedelics and medicinal cannabis. He is the director of the Global Ayahuasca Project, which aims to increase our understanding of ayahuasca drinking context across the world, including why people drink it, the reported impacts of ayahuasca on health and wellbeing and the potential risks associated. His team\xe2\x80\x99s latest research, published in PLOS Global Public Health provides potentially the largest source of information on ayahuasca\xe2\x80\x99s adverse side effects to date. The Global Ayahuasca Project online surveyThe researchers analyzed data from an online Global Ayahuasca Survey that ran from 2017\xe2\x80\x932019, recruiting 10,836 respondents from over 50 countries.The questionnaire obtained demographic information, such as age, sex, level of education and history of mental health diagnoses, and data relating to ayahuasca drinking history, such as frequency, patterns and contexts of use. Participants were asked to report any acute adverse physical effects via a checkbox system, and a subsequent question asked whether they had ever experienced any medium-term mental health, emotional or perceptual changes in the weeks or months following ayahuasca ceremonies or sessions.Responders for whom the \xe2\x80\x9cadverse effects\xe2\x80\x9d section of the questionnaire was not complete were excluded from the final analyses. In total, Perkins and teams\xe2\x80\x99 study included 8,216 responses for the adverse physical effects section of the questionnaire, and 7,839 responses for the adverse mental effects section. Approximately 46% of the participants were female with an average age of 40 years and over.Nausea and vomiting the most common physical side effectAcute physical health adverse effects were reported by 69.9% of the sample, the most common being vomiting and nausea (68.2%), headache (17.8%) and abdominal pain (12.8%). The researchers emphasize that vomiting and nausea are considered a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d effect of ayahuasca for experienced users: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the case of traditional ayahuasca ceremonies and even in non-traditional ceremonies, not only is vomiting/nausea not considered an adverse effect, but it is even sought out for its purging and perceived spiritual cleansing benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d they write in the paper.Approximately 2.3% of the participants reported that they required medical attention for any adverse effects. \xe2\x80\x9cThese results are consistent with previous studies, with regular users reporting that most adverse physical effects seem to not be serious and do not compromise health,\xe2\x80\x9d Perkins and colleagues explain.Several factors were more likely to be associated with adverse events occurring, including:A higher use of ayahuasca in the previous year or lifetimeThe age of participants \xe2\x80\x93 those that were older when they first drank ayahuasca were more likely to experience adverse eventsPhysical health conditionsComorbidity anxiety disorderPrevious diagnosis of a substance use disorderUse of ayahuasca in a non-supervised contextAn uncomfortable experience?Fifty five percent of the survey responders reported adverse mental health effects, a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively high\xe2\x80\x9d figure according to the researchers. However, \xe2\x80\x9calthough the frequency of any adverse mental health effects was high, only \xe2\x80\x98hearing or seeing things that other people do not hear or see\xe2\x80\x99 was observed in 28.5% of the ayahuasca users,\xe2\x80\x9d the researchers say.Approximately 21% of participants reported \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling disconnected or alone\xe2\x80\x9d, while 4.4% experienced visual distortions. The duration of any adverse mental health effect reported in the survey was less than one week. When asked to offer qualitative perspectives on these experiences, some of the participants expressed how they are considered a positive element of their ayahuasca journey.Ayahuasca is not just a pharmacological experience \xe2\x80\x93 it is considered a spiritual practice in its tradition. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the context of such experiences, it is not surprising that a process of psychological integration and assimilation may be required,\xe2\x80\x9d Perkins and colleagues note.\xe2\x80\x9cI have had numerous experiences where ayahuasca has brought difficult patterns into my awareness in my daily life, which is never comfortable but always results in growth in the end,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 an anonymized quote from one of the survey participants. Ayahuasca drinking history variables were not significantly associated with adverse mental health effects. \xe2\x80\x9cThis finding, while intriguing, is in accordance with the early age of ayahuasca initiation in traditional contexts, both Indigenous and in ayahuasca churches, where researchers\xc2\xa0failed to find long-term neuropsychiatric alterations,\xe2\x80\x9d the authors note. Previous work by Dr. Jos\xc3\xa9 Carlos Bouso, director of the International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service and a co-author of the paper, also found that long-term use of ayahuasca was associated with a higher positive perception of health or with a healthy lifestyle.Implications for global health There are limitations to the study design that must be acknowledged and could limit its validity, including its reliance on self-reported data gathered in a retrospective nature. However, the large sample size makes this work \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important source of information regarding ayahuasca\xe2\x80\x99s adverse effects\xe2\x80\x9d to date, in the research team\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. But what does this resource tell us? It appears that ayahuasca has notable \xe2\x80\x93 though rarely severe \xe2\x80\x93 side effects on both physical and mental health, which have implications for public health: \xe2\x80\x9cIn that sense, ayahuasca practices can hardly be assessed with the same parameters used for prescription medicines,\xe2\x80\x9d the authors say, \xe2\x80\x9csince the myriad of its effects include challenging experiences that are intrinsic to the experience, some of which are considered as part of its healing process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cMany are turning to ayahuasca due to disenchantment with conventional Western mental health treatments, however the disruptive power of this traditional medicine should not be underestimated, commonly resulting in mental health or emotional challenges during assimilation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile these are usually transitory and seen as part of a beneficial growth process, risks are greater for vulnerable individuals or when used in unsupportive contexts,\xe2\x80\x9d the researchers conclude.Reference: Bouso J, Andion O\xc2\xb4, Sarris J et al.

The equations that describe how ripples crease the surface of a pond have also helped researchers to predict the weather, design better airplanes, and characterize how blood flows through the circulatory system. These equations are deceptively simple when written in the right mathematical language. However, their solutions are so complex that making sense of even basic questions about them can be prohibitively difficult. Perhaps the oldest and most prominent of these equations, formulated by Leonhard Euler more than 250 years ago, describe the flow of an ideal, incompressible fluid: a fluid with no viscosity, or internal friction, that cannot be forced into a smaller volume. \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all nonlinear fluid equations are kind of derived from the Euler equations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tarek Elgindi, a mathematician at Duke University. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the first ones, you could say.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet much remains unknown about the Euler equations \xe2\x80\x94 including whether they\xe2\x80\x99re always an accurate model of ideal fluid flow. One of the central problems in fluid dynamics is to figure out if the equations ever fail, outputting nonsensical values that render them unable to predict a fluid\xe2\x80\x99s future states. Mathematicians have long suspected that there exist initial conditions that cause the equations to break down. But they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to prove it. In a preprint posted online last month, a pair of mathematicians has shown that a particular version of the Euler equations does indeed sometimes fail. The proof marks a major breakthrough \xe2\x80\x94 and while it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t completely solve the problem for the more general version of the equations, it offers hope that such a solution is finally within reach. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing result,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tristan Buckmaster, a mathematician at the University of Maryland who was not involved in the work. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no results of its kind in the literature.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s just one catch. The 177-page proof \xe2\x80\x94 the result of a decade-long research program \xe2\x80\x94 makes significant use of computers. This arguably makes it difficult for other mathematicians to verify it. (In fact, they are still in the process of doing so, though many experts believe the new work will turn out to be correct.) It also forces them to reckon with philosophical questions about what a \xe2\x80\x9cproof\xe2\x80\x9d is, and what it will mean if the only viable way to solve such important questions going forward is with the help of computers. Sighting the Beast In principle, if you know the location and velocity of each particle in a fluid, the Euler equations should be able to predict how the fluid will evolve for all time. But mathematicians want to know if that\xe2\x80\x99s actually the case. Perhaps in some situations, the equations will proceed as expected, producing precise values for the state of the fluid at any given moment, only for one of those values to suddenly skyrocket to infinity. At that point, the Euler equations are said to give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9csingularity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or, more dramatically, to \xe2\x80\x9cblow up.\xe2\x80\x9d Once they hit that singularity, the equations will no longer be able to compute the fluid\xe2\x80\x99s flow. But \xe2\x80\x9cas of a few years ago, what people were able to do fell very, very far short of [proving blowup],\xe2\x80\x9d said Charlie Fefferman, a mathematician at Princeton University. It gets even more complicated if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to model a fluid that has viscosity (as almost all real-world fluids do). A million-dollar Millennium Prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute awaits anyone who can prove whether similar failures occur in the Navier-Stokes equations, a generalization of the Euler equations that accounts for viscosity. In 2013, Thomas Hou, a mathematician at the California Institute of Technology, and Guo Luo, now at the Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, proposed a scenario in which the Euler equations would lead to a singularity. They developed a computer simulation of a fluid in a cylinder whose top half swirled clockwise while its bottom half swirled counterclockwise. As they ran the simulation, more complicated currents started to move up and down. That, in turn, led to strange behavior along the boundary of the cylinder where opposing flows met. The fluid\xe2\x80\x99s vorticity \xe2\x80\x94 a measure of rotation \xe2\x80\x94 grew so fast that it seemed poised to blow up. Hou and Luo\xe2\x80\x99s work was suggestive, but not a true proof. That\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for a computer to calculate infinite values. It can get very close to seeing a singularity, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t actually reach it \xe2\x80\x94 meaning that the solution might be very accurate, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still an approximation. Without the backing of a mathematical proof, the value of the vorticity might only seem to be increasing to infinity because of some artifact of the simulation. The solutions might instead grow to enormous numbers before again subsiding. Such reversals had happened before: A simulation would indicate that a value in the equations blew up, only for more sophisticated computational methods to show otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cThese problems are so delicate that the road is littered with the wreckage of previous simulations,\xe2\x80\x9d Fefferman said. In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s how Hou got his start in this area: Several of his earlier results disproved the formation of hypothetical singularities. Still, when he and Luo published their solution, most mathematicians thought it was very likely a true singularity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very meticulous, very precise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vladimir Sverak, a mathematician at the University of Minnesota. \xe2\x80\x9cThey really went to great lengths to establish that this is a real scenario.\xe2\x80\x9d Subsequent work by Elgindi, Sverak and others only strengthened that conviction. But a proof was elusive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve sighted the beast,\xe2\x80\x9d Fefferman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you try to capture it.\xe2\x80\x9d That meant showing that the approximate solution that Hou and Luo so carefully simulated is, in a specific mathematical sense, very, very close to an exact solution of the equations. Now, nine years after that first sighting, Hou and his former graduate student Jiajie Chen have finally succeeded in proving the existence of that nearby singularity. The Move to Self-Similar Land Hou, later joined by Chen, took advantage of the fact that, upon closer analysis, the approximate solution from 2013 seemed to have a special structure. As the equations evolved through time, the solution displayed what\xe2\x80\x99s called a self-similar pattern: Its shape later on looked a lot like its earlier shape, only re-scaled in a specific way. As a result, the mathematicians didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to try to look at the singularity itself. Instead, they could study it indirectly by focusing on an earlier point in time. By zooming in on that part of the solution at the right rate \xe2\x80\x94 determined based on the solution\xe2\x80\x99s self-similar structure \xe2\x80\x94 they could model what would happen later on, including at the singularity itself. It took a few years for them to find a self-similar analogue to the 2013 blowup scenario. (Earlier this year, another team of mathematicians, which included Buckmaster, used different methods to find a similar approximate solution. They are currently using that solution to develop an independent proof of singularity formation.) With an approximate self-similar solution in hand, Hou and Chen needed to show that an exact solution exists nearby. Mathematically, this is equivalent to proving that their approximate self-similar solution is stable \xe2\x80\x94 that even if you were to slightly perturb it and then evolve the equations starting at those perturbed values, there\xe2\x80\x99d be no way to escape a small neighborhood around the approximate solution. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a black hole,\xe2\x80\x9d Hou said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you start with a profile close by, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sucked in.\xe2\x80\x9d But having a general strategy was just one step toward the solution. \xe2\x80\x9cFussy details matter,\xe2\x80\x9d Fefferman said. As Hou and Chen spent the next several years working out those details, they found that they had to rely on computers once again \xe2\x80\x94 but this time in an entirely new way. A Hybrid Approach Among their first challenges was figuring out the exact statement they had to prove. They wanted to show that if they took any set of values close to their approximate solution and plugged it into the equations, the output wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stray far. But what does it mean for an input to be \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d to the approximate solution? They had to specify this in a mathematical statement \xe2\x80\x94 but there are many ways to define the notion of distance in this context. For their proof to work, they needed to choose the correct one. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has to measure different physical effects,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rafael de la Llave, a mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it needs to be chosen using a deep understanding of the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Once they had the right way to describe \xe2\x80\x9ccloseness,\xe2\x80\x9d Hou and Chen had to prove the statement, which boiled down to a complicated inequality involving terms from both the re-scaled equations and the approximate solution. The mathematicians had to make sure that the values of all those terms balanced out to something very small: If one value ended up being large, other values had to be negative or kept in check. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you make something a little too big or a little too small, the whole thing breaks down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Javier G\xc3\xb3mez-Serrano, a mathematician at Brown University. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very careful, delicate work.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a really fierce fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Elgindi added. To get the tight bounds they needed on all these different terms, Hou and Chen broke the inequality into two major parts. They could take care of the first part by hand, with techniques including one that dates back to the 18th century, when the French mathematician Gaspard Monge sought an optimal way of transporting soil to build fortifications for Napoleon\xe2\x80\x99s army. \xe2\x80\x9cStuff like this has been done before, but I found it striking that [Hou and Chen] used it for this,\xe2\x80\x9d Fefferman said. That left the second part of the inequality. Tackling it would require computer assistance. For starters, there were so many calculations that needed to be done, and so much precision required, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of work you\xe2\x80\x99d have to do with pencil and paper would be staggering,\xe2\x80\x9d de la Llave said. To get various terms to balance out, the mathematicians had to perform a series of optimization problems that are relatively easy for computers but exceedingly time-consuming for humans. Some of the values also depended on quantities from the approximate solution; since that was calculated using a computer, it was more straightforward to also use a computer to perform these additional computations. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you try to manually do some of these estimates, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to overestimate at some point, and then you lose,\xe2\x80\x9d said G\xc3\xb3mez-Serrano. \xe2\x80\x9cThe numbers are so tiny and tight \xe2\x80\xa6 and the margin is incredibly thin.\xe2\x80\x9d But because computers can\xe2\x80\x99t manipulate an infinite number of digits, tiny errors inevitably occur. Hou and Chen had to carefully track those errors, to make sure they didn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with the rest of the balancing act. Ultimately, they were able to find bounds for all the terms, completing the proof: The equations had indeed produced a singularity. Proof by Computer It remains open whether more complicated equations \xe2\x80\x94 the Euler equations without the presence of a cylindrical boundary and the Navier-Stokes equations \xe2\x80\x94 can develop a singularity. \xe2\x80\x9cBut [this work] at least gives me hope,\xe2\x80\x9d Hou said. \xe2\x80\x9cI see a path forward, a way to maybe even eventually resolve the full Millennium problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, Buckmaster and G\xc3\xb3mez-Serrano are working on a computer-assisted proof of their own \xe2\x80\x94 one they hope will be more general, and therefore capable of tackling not just the problem that Hou and Chen solved, but also scores of others. These efforts mark a growing trend in the field of fluid dynamics: the use of computers to solve important problems. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a number of different areas of mathematics, it\xe2\x80\x99s occurring more and more frequently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Friedlander, a mathematician at the University of Southern California. But in fluid mechanics, computer-assisted proofs are still a relatively new technique. In fact, when it comes to statements about singularity formation, Hou and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s proof is the first of its kind: Previous computer-assisted proofs were only able to tackle toy problems in the area. Such proofs aren\xe2\x80\x99t so much controversial as \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Constantin\xc2\xa0of Princeton University. Mathematicians generally agree that a proof has to convince other mathematicians that some line of reasoning is correct. But, many argue, it should also improve their understanding of why a particular statement is true, rather than simply provide validation that it\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xe2\x80\x9cDo we learn anything fundamentally new, or do we just know the answer to the question?\xe2\x80\x9d Elgindi said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you view mathematics as an art, then this is not so aesthetically pleasing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA computer can help. It\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful. It gives me insight. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give me a full understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d Constantin added. \xe2\x80\x9cUnderstanding comes from us.\xe2\x80\x9d For his part, Elgindi still hopes to work out an alternative proof of blowup entirely by hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m overall happy this exists,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Hou and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s work. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I take it as more of a motivation to try to do it in a less computer-dependent way.\xe2\x80\x9d Other mathematicians view computers as a vital new tool that will make it possible to attack previously intractable problems. \xe2\x80\x9cNow the work is no longer just paper and pencil,\xe2\x80\x9d Chen said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the option of using something more powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d According to him and others (including Elgindi, despite his personal preference for writing proofs by hand), there\xe2\x80\x99s a good possibility that the only way to solve big problems in fluid dynamics \xe2\x80\x94 that is, problems that involve increasingly complicated equations \xe2\x80\x94 might be to rely heavily on computer assistance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looks to me as if trying to do this without making heavy use of computer-assisted proofs is like tying one or possibly two hands behind your back,\xe2\x80\x9d Fefferman said. If that does end up being the case and \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t have any choice,\xe2\x80\x9d Elgindi said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen people \xe2\x80\xa6 such as myself, who would say that this is suboptimal, should be quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d That would also mean that more mathematicians would need to start learning the skills needed to write computer-assisted proofs \xe2\x80\x94 something that Hou and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s work will hopefully inspire. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there were a lot of people who were simply waiting for someone to solve such a problem before investing any of their own time into this approach,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckmaster said. That said, when it comes to debates about the extent to which mathematicians should rely on computers, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not that you need to pick a side,\xe2\x80\x9d G\xc3\xb3mez-Serrano said. \xe2\x80\x9c[Hou and Chen\xe2\x80\x99s] proof wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work without the analysis, and the proof wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work without the computer assistance. \xe2\x80\xa6 I think the value is that people can speak the two languages.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, de la Llave said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a new game in town.\xe2\x80\x9d Share this articleFacebookTwitterCopied!Copy link EmailPocketRedditYcombinatorFlipboardNewsletterGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inboxSubscribe nowRecent newslettersBy Jordana CepelewiczSenior WriterNovember 16, 2022View PDF/Print Modefluid dynamicsmathematical physicsmathematicsNavier-Stokes equationspartial differential equationsAll topicsShare this articleFacebookTwitterCopied!Copy link EmailPocketRedditYcombinatorFlipboardNewsletterGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inboxSubscribe nowRecent newslettersThe Quanta NewsletterGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inboxEmailSubscribeRecent newslettersComment on this articleQuanta Magazine moderates comments to\xc2\xa0facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

HelenOS is a portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designed and implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interface into a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact with each other via message passing. A failure or crash of one component does not directly harm others. HelenOS is therefore flexible, modular, extensible, fault tolerant and easy to understand. HelenOS aims to be compatible with the C11 and C++14 standards, but does not aspire to be a clone of any existing operating system and trades compatibility with legacy APIs for cleaner design. Most of HelenOS components have been made to order specifically for HelenOS so that its essential parts can stay free of adaptation layers, glue code, franken-components and the maintenance burden incurred by them. HelenOS runs on eight different processor architectures and machines ranging from embedded ARM devices and single-board computers through multicore 32-bit and 64-bit desktop PCs to 64-bit Itanium and SPARC rack-mount servers.

And chances are, you\'ve already seen one and didn\'t know it was a deepfake.The very real-looking characteristics of deepfakes have allowed for many instances of misinformation, hoaxes, and fraud to disseminate online. In response, Intel announced a new technology called ""FakeCatcher"" to detect deepfake media with a 96% accuracy rate.Artificial Intelligence The new Turing test: Are you human? AI is running out of computing power. IBM says the answer is this new chip How to use DALL\xe2\x80\xa2E 2 to turn your wildest imaginations into tangible art AI\'s true goal may no longer be intelligence Deepfakes use impressive technology derived from machine learning and artificial intelligence to create scarily accurate impressions of celebrities and politicians doing and saying things they haven\'t.\xc2\xa0Existing technologies can take hours to dispel web surfers\' trust in a deepfake, as they use deep learning to investigate signs of digital manipulation.Also:\xc2\xa0How to spot a deepfake? One simple trick is all you needIntel\'s FakeCatcher can detect a deepfake in real time by ""assessing what makes us human \xe2\x80\x93  lood flow\' in the pixels of a video,"" according to a press release.\xc2\xa0Intel says its technology can identify changes in our veins\' color when blood circulates through the body. Signals of blood flow are then collected from the face and translated by algorithms to discern if a video is real or a deepfake.\xc2\xa0It\'s becoming increasingly important to have software to help us identify deepfakes to avoid harmful consequences. Some deepfake videos and images are graphic in nature, and others perpetuate distrust in the media.\xc2\xa0In the past, scammers have used deepfakes to pose as job seekers to access sensitive company information. They\'ve also been used to impersonate prominent political figures to say inflammatory statements.\xc2\xa0Although some movements and mannerisms in deepfakes give away their deceptive nature, most people mindlessly scroll through their Twitter feed and don\'t take the time to find out if a video is real or fake.\xc2\xa0Also:\xc2\xa0The next big security threat is staring us in the face. Tackling it is going to be toughAnd by the time a deepfake garners millions of shares, it\'s far too late, as 63% of adults in the US admit that an altered video has confused them about current events, according to the Pew Research Center.\xc2\xa0More Black Friday deals ZDNET\'s Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2022 deals hub The best early Black Friday deals happening right now These early Black Friday VPN deals are some of the lowest prices we\'ve seen Black Friday smartwatch deals: Get an Apple Watch for $179 right now Black Friday tablet deals: Amazon\'s Fire HD 10 tablet is currently 50% off Black Friday iPad deals: The iPad Pro and iPad Mini are already on sale ZDNET\'s Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2022 deals hub The best early Black Friday deals happening right now These early Black Friday VPN deals are some of the lowest prices we\'ve seen Black Friday smartwatch deals: Get an Apple Watch for $179 right now Black Friday tablet deals: Amazon\'s Fire HD 10 tablet is currently 50% off Black Friday iPad deals: The iPad Pro and iPad Mini are already on sale Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related Artemis: Orion spacecraft takes next step towards the Moon with first course correction burn Artemis: Orion spacecraft takes next step towards the Moon with first course correction burn The mysterious X-37B orbital spaceplane just returned after an epic mission The mysterious X-37B orbital spaceplane just returned after an epic mission What graphics card do I have?

First some background. Why would you want to do this? Typically, if you have a custom domain that you want to use for email, then you\xe2\x80\x99d have to administer or have access to an email server for it. This email server will need to have DNS MX records set up for it, and will also need a good sender reputation if your emails aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to end up in spam. Normally, to \xe2\x80\x9cSend mail as\xe2\x80\x9d in Gmail, you\xe2\x80\x99d enter the custom domain\xe2\x80\x99s email server SMTP details, and your email username and password. Then when you send emails from Gmail, Google contacts that mail server, and the emails go out from it, rather than from Gmail. The advantage of this is that you can let the domain\xe2\x80\x99s email server sign the emails with a DKIM signature, as well as having whatever email addresses you want on that custom domain. The downside, is that you need an email server, and inboxes for those custom addresses. However, now that Cloudflare have made email routing available for domains where they are the authoritative nameserver (host your domain\xe2\x80\x99s DNS records), you can use Gmail to send emails using your custom domain, and Cloudflare to route them, doing away with the need for a custom mailserver entirely. How to use Gmail\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSend mail as\xe2\x80\x9d with a custom domain and Cloudflare email routing 1. Configure Cloudflare First you\xe2\x80\x99ll need a domain configured to use Cloudflare, if not you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to change the domain\xe2\x80\x99s authoritative nameservers first. Then you can setup Cloudflare email routing. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be given some DNS records to set up by default, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to alter these slightly. 1.1 Edit your SPF record Your spf TXT record will need to look like this: copy to clipboardv=spf1 a mx include:_spf.google.com include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net ~all \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve added a mx include:_spf.google.com to indicate that google can send on our behalf, along with Cloudflare. 1.2 Edit your DMARC record Change it so it looks like this: copy to clipboardv=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:you@example.com; aspf=r; \xe2\x80\x93 where example.com is your custom domain. The email address in the rua field can be anything at your custom domain; it\xe2\x80\x99s where email providers will periodically send you aggregated reports about your domain\xe2\x80\x99s email. We\xe2\x80\x99ve set the domain policy p to none (other options are quarantine and reject if sending mail fails to pass DMARC checks). The SPF alignment policy aspf is set to relaxed r. Setting the above is critical to not getting your custom domain\xe2\x80\x99s email bounced or rejected, especially as it won\xe2\x80\x99t be DKIM signed by Gmail. 1.3 Create an Email Route In your Cloudflare dashboard, click the Email option, then add a destination address - use your regular gmail address your.name@gmail.com etc. You\xe2\x80\x99ll need to click the email that\xe2\x80\x99s sent to you to confirm this. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve done that, you can add a custom email address e.g. special@example.com and route it the gmail address you just confirmed. 2. Configure Gmail Next we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the Gmail configuration. 2.1 Create an app password First you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to create an email app password in your Google account. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and choose Email from the \xe2\x80\x9cSelect app\xe2\x80\x9d dropdown and Other for the device. Copy the password that\xe2\x80\x99s generated for you. 2.2 Add the email address to Gmail\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSend mail as\xe2\x80\x9d section There are detailed instructions on adding a new email address, but it\xe2\x80\x99s relatively easy. Go to your Gmail account settings and in the Send mail as: section, click the Add another email address option. In the pop-up, enter your custom domain\xe2\x80\x99s email address, untick the Treat as an alias option, click the Specify a different \xe2\x80\x9creply-to\xe2\x80\x9d address link and add the same custom email address in there. Then click Next Step. Overwrite the value for SMTP Server. Use smtp.gmail.com, leave the Port option as is. Username should be the name part of your regular gmail address, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re your.name@gmail.com then you\xe2\x80\x99d enter your.name. The Password is the email app password that you generated above. Click the Add Account button. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be sent an email to the custom email address you entered. Click the link in this, and you\xe2\x80\x99re good to go. All done You\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to compose emails in Gmail and set the sender to your custom domain email address, and when people reply, Cloudflare will route these back to your regular gmail account, all without you needing a separate custom mail server.

The concept of \xe2\x80\x9cred-teaming\xe2\x80\x9d comes from cybersecurity. A red team is a group of people who have been authorized to act as an attacker in a given organization and probe for threats against a company\xe2\x80\x99s security set-up. What they do can range from social engineering to penetration testing. The counter to this is the blue team, who defends against the red-team in this simulated scenario.In this case, the researchers acting as the red team are trying to understand if they can bypass the safety filter that performs a high-level check on the output of a prompt generated by the Stable Diffusion model as hosted by HuggingFace in the Diffusers Toolkit.Quick notes on diffusion models and Stable DiffusionStable Diffusion is a text-to-image model released publicly in mid-2022 (seems like forever ago) that generates images based on text prompts that the user inputs. Other, earlier models in the diffusion family include DALL-E and Midjourney, both of which were gated behind websites without a chance to inspect the code.At an extremely high level, diffusion models work by learning to add statistically distributed noise to an image or a representation of an image and then, again, statistically removing noise until you get a picture that matches the properties of the input dataset but is, statistically, not the same image that was input.sourceStable Diffusion works by:Taking a large training set of real images (StableDiffusion itself was trained on 2.3 Billion images that are part of the LAION dataset and selected based on images that match a threshold for \xe2\x80\x9caesthetic score\xe2\x80\x9d.)To make the pre-processing steps faster, the images are compressed into a smaller-dimension representation using a variational autoencoder - the paper romantically calls this \xe2\x80\x9cdeparture to latent space.\xe2\x80\x9dDuring the pre-processing used to generate the model\xe2\x80\x99s input data, Gaussian noise is applied to the images\xe2\x80\x99 latent representation.Each time we add noise to a step, we generatively build the part of the model called a \xe2\x80\x9cnoise predictor\xe2\x80\x9d, which then allows us, for any given image, to probabilistically predict how much noise was added and how far it deviates from the original image. That prediction allows us to compare to the known noise from the original training data.Once we train this noise predictor we can then run a decoder to denoise the data in small increments, which will remove that noise from a given image until we get a different image than the training set, but one that is semantically similar to the training set.Here\xe2\x80\x99s the overall image-specific architecture:How do we now incorporate text? During inference, diffusion models work by adding guidance (otherwise, we\xe2\x80\x99d just get random images without ability to steer from a text prompt):The model uses a Transformer language model, ClipText, to generate textual embeddings for the specific text prompt. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more information on how that model was trained, but the general idea is that you have captioned images in which both the image and the caption, separately, are embedded into the same latent space using an encoder and compare the embeddings for the text and image using cosine similarity.We pass these embeddings also into the UNet noising encoder that includes specific attention to the text, as well, and incorporate it in processing so that when we pass in a text prompt, we include that information in inference.HuggingFace DiffusersAs I mentioned, there are several ways to work with this model. If you are lucky enough to have at least 6GB of VRAM, you can download the model and work with it locally. Since there is no safety filter on that model, in the model card, there are a number of different caveats for misuse.Misuse and Malicious Use Using the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to: + Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc. + Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes. + Impersonating individuals without their consent. + Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it. Mis- and disinformation Representations of egregious violence and gore + Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use. Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use. For everyone else, there\xe2\x80\x99s HuggingFace via Google Colab. HuggingFace has a toolbox for diffusion models called Diffusers that also incorporate the ability to perform inference on Stable Diffusion using Pipelines, as well.Digging into the Safety FilterOk! Now that we have that out of the way, we can start to understand the safety filterThere are two versions of Stable Diffusion, one that you can clone and run on your own if you have enough hardware, and one that is hosted by HuggingFace using its Diffusers library which you can run as a HuggingFace pipeline from either a local or Colab notebook. In order to perform inference against this version, you need to authenticate against HuggingFace\xe2\x80\x99s API.If you\xe2\x80\x99ve played around with Stable Diffusion, you may have noticed that you get a black box for a given prompt. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example I was playing around with while trying to generate an image for another blog post I was working on around the topic of embeddings:The blog post notes,If at some point you get a black image, it may be because the content filter built inside the model might have detected an NSFW result. If you believe this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the case, try tweaking your prompt or using a different seed. In fact, the model predictions include information about whether NSFW was detected for a particular result. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what they look like:Why would dolphins be censored though? The way the safety filter works, as described by the paper is:The user inputs a text prompt for inferenceAn image is generated by Stable Diffusion for the userBefore being shown to the user, that image is projected into the CLIP embedding space, the same space used for the text training of Stable DiffusionThe image\xe2\x80\x99s embedding is compared to one of 17 fixed embedding vectors in CLIP that are determined to be pre-sensitive concept filters, and if the cosine similarity is above some threshold, the image is filtered out and the user is shown the black box.All of this happens at inference time, which is amazingly fast.As the paper points out, the code for the safety check actually happens here:There are a number of interesting parts here, but the takeaway is that, ultimately in the face of incredible deep learning technology, content safety still ends up being a very human-judgment driven task.Check this out, for example, the piece of code that is responsible for tuning the filter, right now very manual and based on a human-judgment threshold, as well as the 17 concepts (unclear what these are, only what their embedding representations are):# increase this value to create a stronger `nfsw` filter # at the cost of increasing the possibility of filtering benign images adjustment = 0.0 for concept_idx in range(len(special_cos_dist[0])): concept_cos = special_cos_dist[i][concept_idx] concept_threshold = self.special_care_embeds_weights[concept_idx].item() result_img[""special_scores""][concept_idx] = round(concept_cos - concept_threshold + adjustment, 3) if result_img[""special_scores""][concept_idx] > 0: result_img[""special_care""].append({concept_idx, result_img[""special_scores""][concept_idx]}) adjustment = 0.01 for concept_idx in range(len(cos_dist[0])): concept_cos = cos_dist[i][concept_idx] concept_threshold = self.concept_embeds_weights[concept_idx].item() result_img[""concept_scores""][concept_idx] = round(concept_cos - concept_threshold + adjustment, 3) if result_img[""concept_scores""][concept_idx] > 0: result_img[ ad_concepts""].append(concept_idx) result.append(result_img) has_nsfw_concepts = [len(res[ ad_concepts""]) > 0 for res in result] for idx, has_nsfw_concept in enumerate(has_nsfw_concepts): if has_nsfw_concept: images[idx] = np.zeros(images[idx].shape) # black image if any(has_nsfw_concepts): logger.warning( ""Potential NSFW content was detected in one or more images. A black image will be returned instead."" "" Try again with a different prompt and/or seed."" ) return images, has_nsfw_concepts The researchers note the opaqueness of this classification (i.e. why did my dolphin image get flagged, what was it close to in the latent space?) and do a bunch of additional work in testing prompts to find out what bypasses the safety filter.And, in an additional piece of really impressive work, reverse-engineering the CLIP embeddings to find out what the sensitive terms actually are (last page of the linked paper here.)So what are the hypotheses for why my prompt could have been filtered? The simple answer is that the generated image\xe2\x80\x99s embedding representation ended up being close to the embedding representation one of 17 sexually-oriented terms from the CLIP model space, as measured by some cosine similarity.Probably easier to just put""Potential NSFW content was detected in one or more images. A black image will be returned instead."" instead.The TakeawayThere are a couple of very, very interesting parts of this paper for me.Even though machine learning models are, in theory, very, very good at detecting NSFW content (in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the key actually-useful use-cases for ML), this is an entirely new space we\xe2\x80\x99re still learning how to navigate for these new deep-learning based approaches to computer vision. The policy has in no way caught up with the tech yet.As such we are still relying on very manual human judgment lists to filter out bad content in deep learning, an area that\xe2\x80\x99s just getting started with this. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked in content safety, you know that these lists can be miles long. 17 is just the very start of what will eventually become a very long list :).There is an ENORMOUS amount of context that you need to evaluate these models, and there is still much about them that is extremely opaque and resistant to evaluation. I am not a stable diffusion expert but I do know machine learning, and even still, I had to do a fair amount of reading to get caught up with the context of this particular paper.We need a lot more introspection, simplification, and education about these models, and this paper is a fantastic starting point.Made with Hugo \xca\x95\xe2\x80\xa2\xe1\xb4\xa5\xe2\x80\xa2\xca\x94 Bear'"

WARNING: Everything described in this article is designed to let you know what you are doing. All at your own peril and risk! If you are not sure - do not try to repeat this at home.So what is the problem? The problem that we will solve for the end user of the computer looks like this: When using a second type of hypervisor (for example, VirtualBox)you cannot run virtual machines with more than one processoryou cannot run 64-bit guest operating systems inside a 32-bit host OS. You can see this message when you try to start a virtual machine with a number of processors greater than 1: You also get a similar error message if you intend to start a 64-bit virtual machine (for example, Debian amd64) from a 32-bit OS host, for example WinXP.Can this be cured? This question can be answered by checking some bits in some processor status words. The easiest way to make sure that in your case the problem is treated is to look at what SecurAble shows . In my case, it looked like this: So, if your program shows the same picture as shown above, then you can cure this problem. However, the nuance is that it is possible to set the desired bit in the processor register only in the BIOS, since the harmful BIOS of your laptop sets it to zero, then it turns on the blocking bit and changing this bit is no longer possible (until the computer reboots, where the BIOS during POST again it will be thrown and locked). BIOS on the Acer Aspire netbook manufactured by Insyde, its settings are very scarce and on F2 we naturally cannot go into the BIOS settings editing program and enable virtualization there. That would be too easy. Therefore, we will disassemble the BIOS and change its code so that our bit is set to 1. If you are ready, then read on.What you need to know before you get started So, some technical information - to understand what we are doing and why. Modern processors, at least many of them, have virtualization support. Bit No. 5 in the ECX word is responsible for it when the CPUID command is called with parameter EAX = 01H. This verification method is the only true one, since, as practice shows, the Intel website is lying, for example, for my Intel Atom N570 processor . This link says:Intel\xc2\xae Virtualization Technology (VT-x) \tNo However, we know that this is not true. For those who are on the \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x9d with assembly language programming, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find out by writing something likeMOV EAX, 1 CPUID and then checking the 5th bit of the ECX register. I was too lazy to do this, so I downloaded the open source CPUID Explorer program , launched it and looked at the result. By the way, CPU-Z is unsuitable here - it gives the result too ""user friendly"" - we also needed to find out the exact value of the bit. Here\'s how it looked in my case: The VMX bit of interest to us is circled. It is set to 1, it is, despite what the Intel website tells us. The processor command documentation on page 215 tells us about the CPUID command, whichBit #5 VMX Virtual Machine Extensions. A value of 1 indicates that the processor supports this technology But that is not all. For hypervisors of the second type to be able to use virtualization support commands (VMX), it is necessary to explicitly enable these instructions in MSR (special processor register) number 0x3A. Here is what the documentation for this register tells us on page 237: register 3Ah: IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL Bit 0: lock bit - if it is set, then further modifications to this register are not allowed until the next reboot. Bit 1: VMX in SMX - safer mode extensions. Virtualization functions in SMX are allowed only when the processor supports SMX - this is indicated in the neighboring 6th bit on ECX when the CPUID.01H command is called - in the picture above this bit is zero, our Atm N570 processor does not support SMX - therefore and in MSR 0x3A, bit No. 1 must be zero. Bit 2: VMX is not in SMX - this, in fact, is the bit responsible for supporting virtualization. It corresponds to a circled bit in the CPUID and it should be set to 1.How to check the contents of MSR 0x3A To make sure that we understood everything about our computer correctly, you need to look at what is actually stored in MSR 0x3A. For this, I used the msr-tools package in Debian (real, not virtual. In virtual, the result is incorrect). This is how you can check the value of this bit: - we are in Debian, then:# apt-get install msr-tools # modprobe msr # rdmsr 0x3A 9 Nine!!! Nine is 00001001. As you can see, our BIOS uses the undocumented bit number 3 in a special register word 0x3A - according to the documentation, this bit is Reserved. But that is not the point. The bottom line is that we have lock bit turned on and our VMX bit No. 2 is turned off - so that\'s right, the SecurAble program is not lying and we really have virtualization support disabled at the BIOS level, although it is supported by the processor. We will rule it.Why this problem needs to be addressed The fact is that with virtualization support (VMX) disabled in the processor word 0x3A, your virtual machines in VirtualBox work in paravirtualization mode. They, unable to transfer the hypervisor to VMX Root and the virtual machine to VMX Non-root operation, are forced to translate processor instructions ON SUMMER. The problem is represented by 17 processor instructions that are not \xe2\x80\x9cVM-safe\xe2\x80\x9d, i.e. they use the only registers or data blocks (tables) in the processor for the entire computer. These commands are: SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, SMSW, PUSHF / POPF, LAR, LSL, VERR / VERW, CALL, JMP, INT n, INTO, RET, STR, and even the trivial MOV! All these instructions change on the fly, so that the virtual machine executes them in a safe form for the system. More details about this problem are described here.(eng.). Because of this, the performance of the virtual machine suffers.What do we need For this task, we need the following things:original BIOS for our netbook from the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s website. IDAphoenixtool210.zip (google knows where to download)HHD Hex Editor Neo or any other HEX EditorFAR Manager :)nasm - for disassemblingKnowledge of how to fill BIOS with emergency method To begin with, it is very important to know that if something goes wrong, then how to restore the computer. For my InsydeH20 BIOS notebook there is an undocumented BIOS recovery procedure:format USB HDD in FAT16 with a partition of 100 megabytes (FAT32 does not understand)upload one file with compressed bios there (ZE6.fd in my case)turn off the laptop, then remove all USB devices and the batteryunplug the power cordconnect USB HDDpress and hold Esc + Fnplug in the power and after 5 seconds press the power buttonrelease the keyboard buttons And voila, the motherboard itself (as a riddle) will pump out a new BIOS from the USB HDD and flash it in 1 minute, then the laptop will reboot. I checked this method, filling the standard BIOS in this way from the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s website (of a different version than I had before) - it really works, the BIOS version was updated. In the same way, I decided to eventually upload the downloaded bios to the system. So, we begin: Unpack the BIOS from the SFX archive downloaded from the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s website. Ios itself will have a file name something like ZE6.fdand have a size of 2 megabytes exactly. Next, we need to unpack the BIOS, since it is compressed. To do this, use the PhoenixTool.exe program. In the first field in its window, we indicate this compressed bios, and the program itself decompiles it into, in my case, as many as 609 source files that have names in the format GUID.ext. Some of these files are configuration files, and some are binary files, but all with the ROM extension. Some binaries contain programs with a standard Windows PE header. Our task is to find the file containing the instruction we need among these 609 filesWRMSR it turned out that looking for the MOV EAX, 3AH command in front of the WRMSR command is pointless - in my BIOS, WRMSR is framed as a separate function and takes parameters through the stack. Therefore, I did it this way (it seemed easier to me, cham in the IDA): I installed the nasm package on Linux, which includes ndisasm. Then disassembled all * .ROM files with the commandndisasm -b 32 file.rom > file.asm And then, by a simple search, I found a command wrmsrin them - there were 29 such files. Then each of them had to be loaded into the IDA and looked for the necessary code there that locks the 3AH register. Such code was found in only one file with the name 62D171CB-78CD-4480-8678-C6A2A797A8DE.MOD, and it looked like this (after some of my work on renaming functions to more understandable ones, and adding a couple of comments):LOCK_VMX proc near push esi push 3Ah call ReadMSR pop ecx mov ecx, eax xor esi, esi and ecx, 1 or ecx, esi pop esi jnz short exitprc ; if(ReadMSR() & 1) goto exitprc; push edx or eax, 1 ; Set lock bit (bit #0) push eax push 3Ah call WriteMSR add esp, 0Ch exitprc: retn LOCK_VMX endp By definition, a code that locks a register does this once. Therefore, this is the best place to make our hack: change the number 1 to the number 5 in the instructions:or eax, 1 This will lead to the fact that at the same time setting the lock bit, we set the VMX bit (bit # 2). Note here that we do not have the right to set bit # 1, since the set of SMX instructions is not supported in our processor (this says CPUID.1H: ECX bit 6. We will not change it entirely in the * .ROM file, but in the * .MOD braid , which contains this file, for this you need to use the PhoenixTool.exe program, which is already open and the BIOS has already been loaded into it, click on the Structure button, and find the branch with our file name: We press the Extract button, we get the * .MOD file (which consists of the header + body of the * .ROM file), and we correct our bit in this MOD file. We look in the IDA what binary code corresponds to the neighborhood of the instruction that we are changing, and in the HEX editor we open the file, look for this place in the code, and change only 1 byte from 01 to 05. We save the modified * .MOD file. Then in PhoenixTool, click Replace, select the modified MOD, and click Exit. All. The program itself rebuilt the bios and packed it for us, while calling it the same name as it was (the old file was saved with the .old extension). All. Now fill in the only file with the new BIOS on the USB HDD (you can also on the USB flash drive), and perform the BIOS emergency recovery procedure described above. She will flash the computer with this new BIOS and everything will be ready. Here is what the output of the SecurAble program now looks like: VirtualBox now runs virtual machines with 4 cores (and not with one, as it was before). Now, from under my main 32-bit operating system, I can run 64-bit OSes in virtual machines. And, most importantly, now virtual machines are actually virtualized (the hypervisor uses VMX instructions), rather than paravirtualized ones. PS In the bios of other manufacturers (not Insyde), it is possible to correct not the BIOS itself, but only its settings, extracted by the SYMCMOS.EXE program. The process there is the same, except that in the disassembled BIOS there is a setting number that is used to prohibit or enable VMX, and then this setting is edited directly in the CMOS of the BIOS. In my BIOS, there are no such settings, or the symcmos program does not find them, so this file-cutting path is not suitable in my case. The direct BIOS hack path looks more reliable: in this way we simply ignore any BIOS settings, just set the VMX bit and lock the 0x3A register after that. Happiness is :) Thank you for reading to the end.Tags:BIOSVmxvirtualizationVirtualbox Also popular now: Three in one mouse for $ 16 LEGO\'s birthday! 50 years! Google congratulations!

50,Fast CI with MicroVMs (alexellis.io),https://blog.alexellis.io/blazing-fast-ci-with-microvms/,127,"b'Blazing fast CI with MicroVMs Menu Close Home SWAG Store Subscription Email GitHub Subscribe Menu Blazing fast CI with MicroVMs 10 November 2022 on cicd, bare-metal, kubernetes, DevOps, linux, firecracker Around 6-8 months ago I started exploring MicroVMs out of curiosity. Around the same time, I saw an opportunity to fix self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions. Actuated is now in pilot and aims to solve most if not all of the friction. There\'s three parts to this post: A quick debrief on Firecracker and MicroVMs vs legacy solutions Exploring friction with GitHub Actions from a hosted and self-hosted perspective Blazing fast CI with Actuated, and additional materials for learning more about Firecracker We\'re looking for customers who want to solve the problems explored in this post. Register for the pilot 1) A quick debrief on Firecracker \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5 Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services. I learned about Firecracker mostly by experimentation, building bigger and more useful prototypes. This helped me see what the experience was going to be like for users and the engineers working on a solution. I met others in the community and shared notes with them. Several people asked ""Are microVMs the next thing that will replace containers?"" I don\'t think they are, but they are an important tool where hard isolation is necessary. Over time, one thing became obvious: MicroVMs fill a need that legacy VMs and containers can\'t. If you\'d like to know more about how Firecracker works and how it compares to traditional VMs and Docker, you can replay my deep dive session with Richard Case, Principal Engineer (previously Weaveworks, now at SUSE). Join Alex and Richard Case for a cracking time. The pair share what\'s got them so excited about Firecracker, the kinds of use-cases they see for microVMs, fundamentals of Linux Operating Systems and plenty of demos. 2) So what\'s wrong with GitHub Actions? First let me say that I think GitHub Actions is a far better experience than Travis ever was, and we have moved all our CI for OpenFaaS, inlets and actuated to Actions for public and private repos. We\'ve built up a good working knowledge in the community and the company. I\'ll split this part into two halves. What\'s wrong with hosted runners? Hosted runners are constrained Hosted runners are incredibly convenient, and for most of us, that\'s all we\'ll ever need, especially for public repositories with fast CI builds. Friction starts when the 7GB of RAM and 2 cores allocated causes issues for us - like when we\'re launching a KinD cluster, or trying to run E2E tests and need more power. Running out of disk space is also a common problem when using Docker images. GitHub recently launched new paid plans to get faster runners, however the costs add up, the more you use them. What if you could pay a flat fee, or bring your own hardware? They cannot be used with public repos From GitHub.com: We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow. This is not an issue with GitHub-hosted runners because each GitHub-hosted runner is always a clean isolated virtual machine, and it is destroyed at the end of the job execution. Untrusted workflows running on your self-hosted runner pose significant security risks for your machine and network environment, especially if your machine persists its environment between jobs. Read more about the risks: Self-hosted runner security Despite a stern warning from GitHub, at least one notable CNCF project runs self-hosted ARM64 runners on public repositories. On one hand, I don\'t blame that team, they have no other option if they want to do open source, it means a public repo, which means risking everything knowingly. Is there another way we can help them? I spoke to the GitHub Actions engineering team, who told me that using an ephemeral VM and an immutable OS image would solve the concerns. There\'s no access to ARM runners Building with QEMU is incredibly slow as Frederic Branczyk, Co-founder, Polar Signals found out when his Parca project was taking 33m5s to build. I forked it and changed a line: runs-on: actuated-aarch64 and reduced the total build time to 1m26s. This morning @fredbrancz said that his ARM64 build was taking 33 minutes using QEMU in a GitHub Action and a hosted runner.I ran it on @selfactuated using an ARM64 machine and a microVM.That took the time down to 1m 26s!! About a 22x speed increase. https://t.co/zwF3j08vEV pic.twitter.com/ps21An7B9B\xe2\x80\x94 Alex Ellis (@alexellisuk) October 20, 2022 They limit maximum concurrency On the free plan, you can only launch 20 hosted runners at once, this increases as you pay GitHub more money. Builds on private repos are billed per minute I think this is a fair arrangement. GitHub donates Azure VMs to open source users or any public repo for that matter, and if you want to build closed-source software, you can do so by renting VMs per hour. There\'s a free allowance for free users, then Pro users like myself get a few more build minutes included. However, These are on the standard, 2 Core 7GB RAM machines. What if you didn\'t have to pay per minute of build time? What\'s wrong with self-hosted runners? It\'s challenging to get all the packages right as per a hosted runner I spent several days running and re-running builds to get all the software required on a self-hosted runner for the private repos for OpenFaaS Pro. Guess what? I didn\'t want to touch that machine again afterwards, and even if I built up a list of apt packages, it\'d be wrong in a few weeks. I then had a long period of tweaking the odd missing package and generating random container image names to prevent Docker and KinD from conflicting and causing side-effects. What if we could get an image that had everything we needed and was always up to date, and we didn\'t have to maintain that? Self-hosted runners cause weird bugs due to caching If your job installs software like apt packages, the first run will be different from the second. The system is mutable, rather than immutable and the first problem I faced was things clashing like container names or KinD cluster names. You get limited to one job per machine at a time The default setup is for a self-hosted Actions Runner to only run one job at a time to avoid the issues I mentioned above. What if you could schedule as many builds as made sense for the amount of RAM and core the host has? Docker isn\'t isolated at all If you install Docker, then the runner can take over that machine since Docker runs at root on the host. If you try user-namespaces, many things break in weird and frustrating aways like Kubernetes. Container images and caches can cause conflicts between builds. Kubernetes isn\'t a safe alternative Adding a single large machine isn\'t a good option because of the dirty cache, weird stateful errors you can run into, and side-effects left over on the host. So what do teams do? They turn to a controller called Actions Runtime Controller (ARC). ARC is non trivial to set up and requires you to create a GitHub App or PAT (please don\'t do that), then to provision, monitor, maintain and upgrade a bunch of infrastructure. This controller starts a number of re-usable (not one-shot) Pods and has them register as a runner for your jobs. Unfortunately, they still need to use Docker or need to run Kubernetes which leads us to two awful options: Sharing a Docker Socket (easy to become root on the host) Running Docker In Docker (requires a privileged container, root on the host) There is a third option which is to use a non-root container, but that means you can\'t use sudo in your builds. You\'ve now crippled your CI. What if you don\'t need to use Docker build/run, Kaniko or Kubernetes in CI at all? Well ARC may be a good solution for you, until the day you do need to ship a container image. 3) Can we fix it? Yes we can. Actuated (""cause (a machine or device) to operate."") is a semi-managed solution that we\'re building at OpenFaaS Ltd. A semi-managed solution, where you provide hosts and we do the rest A semi-managed solution, where you provide hosts and we do the rest. You provide your own hosts to run jobs, we schedule to them and maintain a VM image with everything you need. You install our GitHub App, then change runs-on: ubuntu-latest to runs-on: actuated or runs-on: actuated-aarch64 for ARM. Then, provision one or more VMs with nested virtualisation enabled on GCP, DigitalOcean or Azure, or a bare-metal host, and install our agent. That\'s it. If you need ARM support for your project, the a1.metal from AWS is ideal with 16 cores and 32GB RAM, or an Ampere Altra machine like the c3.large.arm64 from Equinix Metal with 80 Cores and 256GB RAM if you really need to push things. The 2020 M1 Mac Mini also works well with Asahi Linux, and can be maxed out at 16GB RAM / 8 Cores. I even tried Frederic\'s Parca job on my Raspberry Pi and it was 26m30s quicker than a hosted runner! Then, whenever a build is scheduled on your organisation, we\'ll schedule a microVM on one of your agents, and GitHub takes over the rest. You get: A fresh, isolated VM for every build, no re-use at all A fast boot time of ~ <1-2s An immutable image, which is updated regularly and built with automation Docker preinstalled and running at boot-up Efficient scheduling and packing of builds to your fleet of hosts It\'s capable of running Docker and Kubernetes (KinD, kubeadm, K3s) with full isolation. You\'ll find some examples in the docs, but anything that works on a hosted runner we expect to work with actuated also.

51,Redbean Tiddlywiki Saver (rpdillon.net),https://rpdillon.net/redbean-tiddlywiki-saver.html,125,"b'Redbean Tiddlywiki Saver: rpdillon.net \xe2\x80\x94 Rick\'s Home Online Redbean Tiddlywiki Saver 2022-02-24 Tiddlywiki is a great tool, but because it runs in the browser, it has only limited access to the filesystem to save changes. This has led to dozens of tools called ""savers"" that work with Tiddlywiki to save it. These span the gamut, including full fledged desktop apps (most notably TiddlyDesktop), browser extensions, and server applications of varying complexity. But all of these rely on a single capability built-in to Tiddlywiki that allows it to save itself to any WebDAV server. In addition to purpose-built servers, Tiddlywiki can save itself to WebDAV servers available for:NginxApacheCaddyI started to consider writing a tiny version of a WebDAV tiddlywiki saver after I ran across jart\'s phenomenal Redbean project, which is a webserver contained as an \xce\xb1c\xcf\x84\xc2\xb5\xce\xb1lly p\xce\xb4r\xcf\x84\xce\xb1bl\xce\xb5 \xce\xb5x\xce\xb5c\xc2\xb5\xcf\x84\xce\xb1bl\xce\xb5. This approach appeals strongly to my love of small, self-contained tools (one of the reasons I love Tiddlywiki!) It\'s a web server application that is also a zip archive. By adding Lua code and assets to the zip archive, and then executing it on most any x86_64 system, it provides a self-contained, offline web application. After reading through the documentation for Redbean, it occurred to me that it should be not only possible, but quite easy to write a Redbean application that not only is a saver for Tiddlywiki, but can bundle the wiki into the application itself, creating a completely self-contained Tiddlywiki application.But, I\'ve never worked with Redbean before, so these are my notes on implementing this idea.Redbean\'s Hello WorldHere\'s my hello world in index.lua:Write(""<html>"") Write(""<head><title>Redbean Lua Demo</title></head>"") Write(""<body>"") Write(""This is just a demo page...hello, world!"") Write(""</body>"") Write(""</html>"")I then build the executable using a small script:if [! -f redbean.com ]; then curl https://redbean.dev/redbean-latest.com > redbean.com chmod +x redbean.com fi cp redbean.com wiki.com zip wiki.com index.lua ./wiki.comServing a TiddlywikiInstead of generating HTML in the Lua code, we already have a bundle of HTML to serve: a Tiddlywiki! This means all the Lua code has to do is serve that asset:ServeAsset(""wiki.html"")Of course, we need to provide that wiki.html file to serve. Let\'s grab one:curl https://tiddlywiki.com/empty.html > wiki.html zip wiki.com index.lua wiki.html ./wiki.comOpening localhost:8080 in the browser, we can see that the wiki loads, and can be edited, but there\'s no saving yet. Adding SavingRedbean has a surprisingly comprehensive set of methods available to tackle the saving piece. In order to enable saving for Tiddlywiki with the built-in DAV tooling, the server needs to understand four major HTTP methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and PUT.To implement HEAD, we want to provide two relevant headers: the Content-Type and the Content-Length. Right now, the goal is to have Redbean store exactly one wiki, so the path to the resource doesn\'t matter. But since we\'ll have to dispatch on method type, we need to extract that first. At the same time, we\'ll hardcode the path to the wiki inside the zip:method = GetMethod() WIKI_PATH=""wiki.html""To implement GET we simply use the logic from above:if method == ""GET"" then ServeAsset(WIKI_PATH) endFor HEAD, two headers are required, and they can be set with SetHeader. One is Content-Length, which is dynamic, so it first needs to load the wiki and get its length before setting the headers:-- GET method above elseif method == ""HEAD"" then wiki = LoadAsset(WIKI_PATH) SetStatus(200) SetHeader(""Content-Type"", ""text/html"") SetHeader(""Content-Length"", tostring(#wiki)) endImplementing OPTIONS has to emulate WebDAV just enough to trick Tiddlywiki into saving using that mechanism. I based these headers from the very sleek Ruby saver written by Jim Foltz.-- GET and HEAD methods above elseif method == ""OPTIONS"" then SetStatus(200) SetHeader(""allow"", ""GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS,CONNECT,PUT,DAV,dav"") SetHeader(""x-api-access-type"", ""file"") SetHeader(""dav"", ""tw5/put"") endThe last method is PUT, which needs to write the payload back to the Redbean archive. Luckily, Redbean provides a StoreAsset function for exactly this case:-- GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS methods above elseif method == ""PUT"" then length = tonumber(GetHeader(""Content-Length"")) body = GetBody() StoreAsset(WIKI_PATH, body) SetStatus(200) endPutting It All TogetherSo, the full script is a compact 21 lines of Lua:method = GetMethod() WIKI_PATH=""wiki.html"" if method == ""GET"" then ServeAsset(WIKI_PATH) elseif method == ""HEAD"" then wiki = LoadAsset(WIKI_PATH) SetStatus(200) SetHeader(""Content-Type"", ""text/html"") SetHeader(""Content-Length"", tostring(#wiki)) elseif method == ""OPTIONS"" then SetStatus(200) SetHeader(""allow"", ""GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS,CONNECT,PUT,DAV,dav"") SetHeader(""x-api-access-type"", ""file"") SetHeader(""dav"", ""tw5/put"") elseif method == ""PUT"" then length = tonumber(GetHeader(""Content-Length"")) body = GetBody() StoreAsset(WIKI_PATH, body) SetStatus(200) endThen all that\'s needed is to inject index.lua, along with a wiki, into the archive and run it:zip wiki.com wiki.html index.lua ./wiki.comWhile this loads and allows editing as before, upon saving, Tiddlywiki throws an error, and the Redbean logs reveal a 413 error: the payload during the PUT is too large. This is because a Tiddlywiki is over 1MB, but the maximum payload size of Redbean is 65k. This can be adjusted during launch...here we\'ll use 5MB:./wiki.com -M 5000000This approach allows Tiddlywiki to load and save exactly as expected, and packs everything into a single 2.5M file.Changelog2022-11-19 - Added details about WebDAV saving mechanism after feedback on HN.'"

The clutch pedal had started to disappear from American-made vehicles before he was born, but suddenly a stick shift wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even available as an option on a muscle car like the Dodge Charger. So, in 2015, he started The Manual Gearbox Preservation Society.

Macey isn\xe2\x80\x99t that dogmatic\xe2\x80\x94his garage is home to both a manual and an automatic\xe2\x80\x94but the longtime car lover and industry veteran is concerned by how automated driving has become. \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in the rural suburbs of Detroit. I spent a lot of time driving Jeeps and smaller cars on those back roads and just having a lot of fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Macey told Robb Report. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was to make an observation as to how cars have evolved in my life, it\xe2\x80\x99s that they\xe2\x80\x99ve become increasingly less engaging.\xe2\x80\x9d Alan Macey knew it was a bad sign when Dodge stopped selling the charger with a manual transmission Photo: Courtesy FCA US LLC Macey is under no illusions. He knows the manual transmission isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to experience a sudden surge in popularity. At the beginning of the 1980s, the percentage of cars rolling off American production lines with a stick shift was just 35 percent, according to The New York Times. In 2020, that number was barely over one percent (or about 188,000 cars)\xe2\x80\x94which might explain why only 18 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s drivers even know how to operate one. But Macey isn\xe2\x80\x99t picking out a suit for the manual gearbox\xe2\x80\x99s funeral, either. In fact, the growing popularity of EVs\xe2\x80\x94many of which are being sold on the promise they\xe2\x80\x99ll further automate the driving experience\xe2\x80\x94has actually given him renewed optimism for the manual transmission. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was in the \xe2\x80\x9970s when quartz watches came out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there were probably a lot of people who thought Swiss automatic watches were going to just be a thing of the past. That even came up more recently with the Apple Watch. But I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re all pretty well aware that the luxury [mechanical] watch industry is very much alive and thriving.\xe2\x80\x9d Porsche Taycan GTS sedan Porsche If you know anything about how EVs work, chances are you\xe2\x80\x99ll think Macey\xe2\x80\x99s hope is misplaced, mainly because one of the main selling points of an all-electric powertrain is that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need a multi-gear transmission to function. Unlike an internal combustion engine, which has a narrow RPM range at which it can operate efficiently\xe2\x80\x94the reason why you need to shift through the gears to stop it from stalling\xe2\x80\x94an electric motor has a much wider optimal range that requires just a single gear. This is why nearly every EV comes with a single-speed direct-drive transmission. But there are exceptions. Take, for example, the Porsche Taycan. Introduced in the fall of 2019, the German marque\xe2\x80\x99s debut EV is a true high-performance vehicle capable of rocketing from zero to 60 mph in 2.6 seconds and hitting a top speed of 161 mph. But what\xe2\x80\x99s really caught the eye of some enthusiasts is the two-speed transmission on its rear axle. The Taycan\xe2\x80\x99s gearbox is an in-house invention, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t know all its intricacies, but this Wired article does a good job of breaking things down. Basically, first gear gives the Taycan more access to torque, allowing it to accelerate even quicker; second allows the motor spin at a lower speed while maintaining speed, thus improving efficiency. Porsche Taycan Turbo S Porsche The Taycan shifts between the two gears automatically\xe2\x80\x94at around 62 mph, according to Engineering Explained\xe2\x80\x94but the presence of a multi-speed transmission opens up the possibility that drivers could do the shifting themselves. And while Porsche doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grant that privilege to its EV drivers just yet, other brands are already open to the possibility. Over the last year, three different companies have shown their willingness to put a stick shift in an EV. During last year\xe2\x80\x99s Monterey Car Week, Gateway Bronco introduced an all-electric version of its popular restomod available with an optional, five-speed manual transmission. Then, this February, a Toyota patent came to light that outlined a system for EVs that includes a shifter and clutch (albeit a fake one). Finally, in April, Jeep unveiled its second Wrangler Magneto concept, which comes equipped with a six-speed manual for \xe2\x80\x9cultimate control over the propulsion system.\xe2\x80\x9d Gateway Bronco Luxe GT EV Gateway Bronco There\xe2\x80\x99s only one EV you can buy today with a manual gearbox: Gateway\xe2\x80\x99s Luxe-GT Ford Bronco. The latest addition to the Illinois shop\xe2\x80\x99s lineup of restomods starts at $265,000 and is indistinguishable from its gas-powered models until you crack open the hood. There you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a Legacy EV-sourced electric crate motor that pumps out 400 hp and 800 ft lbs of torque. As is the case with most EVs, the 4\xc3\x974\xe2\x80\x99s torque is available instantaneously, but if you want even more control over that output, the shop will connect the drive unit to a five-speed manual gearbox that sends power to all four wheels. If you do opt for the manual transmission\xe2\x80\x94which tacks on an additional $11,229\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll see two major benefits, according to Gateway founder Seth Burgett. The first is self-explanatory: the sensation of shifting through the gears yourself. You won\xe2\x80\x99t get much use from the first two gears (it\xe2\x80\x99s not like you need to worry about stalling), but anyone used to rowing their own will feel at home in gears three through five. The second advantage is added control, especially when off-roading, which can be tricky with an internal combustion engine, requiring real patience and control, feathering the clutch to get the power and torque just right. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case with Gateway\xe2\x80\x99s EV, where twist and propulsion are available immediately, with a tap of the foot, once in the right gear setting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have an electric, it\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily precise,\xe2\x80\x9d Burgett said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou press the accelerator pedal until you have the torque and speed you need, and then you back off. You have much tighter control with an electric-powered off-road vehicle than you do a gas-powered vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d The Luxe GT EV is available with a five-speed manual gearbox Gateway Bronco Burgett isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s found this to be the case. Jeep has brought the battery-powered Wrangler Magneto to the last two installments of its annual Moab Easter Safari. The vehicle is a retrofit that started out as a gas-powered 4\xc3\x974, but saw its old engine swapped out for an electric drive unit. One aspect that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been modified, though, is its six-speed manual transmission. While by no means necessary, the automaker has seen actual benefits to the feature, especially when it comes to off-roading. \xe2\x80\x9cThe really neat thing is the control and the finesse off-road, particularly in a really rocky situation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Allen, Jeep\xe2\x80\x99s head of design, told Robb Report. \xe2\x80\x9cThe vehicle reacts like a manual trans, where it\xe2\x80\x99s direct drive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a torque converter to get over or under. But the neat thing is you can\xe2\x80\x99t stall it\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s always the fear when you\xe2\x80\x99re driving a manual transmission in a rocky off-road situation. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t stall, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not running.\xe2\x80\x9d Unfortunately, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a manual gearbox will make it onto one of Jeep\xe2\x80\x99s production EVs, the first of which is scheduled to debut next year. The automaker views the Wrangler Magneto and the upgraded 2.0 version as \xe2\x80\x9can open door to the laboratory. . .a test bed\xe2\x80\x9d that offers Allen and his team a chance to tinker on a working vehicle, with the help of some of the brand\xe2\x80\x99s most diehard supporters. The battery-powered 4\xc3\x974 also shows hardcore enthusiasts they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been forgotten. Jeep Wrangler Magneto 2.0 EV concept Jeep These enthusiasts\xe2\x80\x94some of whom may well be members of The Manual Gearbox Preservation Society\xe2\x80\x94aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to give up on the stick shift. They\xe2\x80\x99re like the music lovers who\xe2\x80\x99ve held on to vinyl through the cassette, CD, MP3 and streaming eras because they believe it simply sounds better. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for Gateway to include a manual transmission as an option on the Luxe-GT, except that there are drivers who truly want it. As long as this interest remains, no matter how niche it may be, someone will keep putting manual gearboxes in cars, SUVs and trucks\xe2\x80\x94whether they technically need it or not. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain technologies that sort of just fade into history because there was never anything really that rewarding about them in the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d Macey says when describing the satisfaction of a particularly nice downshift. \xe2\x80\x9cWhereas other sorts of technologies or activities, there is something about them that transcends their functionality.\xe2\x80\x9d Related Stories Disney Just Bought the World\xe2\x80\x99s 7th-Largest Cruise Ship, the 1,122-Foot \xe2\x80\x98Global Dream\xe2\x80\x99 Want to Fly Like Maverick?

It stands for Public Blue Screen of Death which is a Windowsism but Linux systems are posted there too. If you spend enough time scrolling, you might notice two things: There\xe2\x80\x99s a scary number of these kiosks running networked Windows Nearly all of the Linux kiosks are in a panicked state A kernel panic is an unrecoverable error. It could be a damaged filesystem, bad hardware, a malfunctioning driver, a bitflip, or just a kernel bug. When this happens, a backtrace is printed and the system hangs forever. It won\xe2\x80\x99t respond to ACPI shutdown events and there\xe2\x80\x99s no processes running to report that it\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad state. These panicked kiosks we see are in limbo until they\xe2\x80\x99re power cycled. Some might get power cycled daily, but I\xe2\x80\x99d wager somebody usually needs to come along and do it. This is kind of tragic because it can be prevented by adding one parameter to the boot command line. panic=60 Or it can be set ephemerally with sysctl: $ sysctl -w kernel.panic=60 Use this and the kernel will automatically reboot 60 seconds after a panic. It gives you enough time to snap a pic if you want to look into the issue, but gets the system back up and running shortly if you\xe2\x80\x99re not around to fix it. Of course, if the hardware is indeed damaged or the filesystem is broken, this will just throw it into a boot loop, but you\xe2\x80\x99re no worse off. If you\xe2\x80\x99re building a kiosk, it\xe2\x80\x99s hopefully obvious to avoid having any read-write mounted filesystems at all costs. In fact, this is worth using on any production system you manage. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter where your system is \xe2\x80\x93 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the cloud, on-premise, or inside a fridge \xe2\x80\x93 one day it will panic and this might just save you from being woken up at 1am."""

Al Franken\xe2\x80\x99s or Louis C.K.\xe2\x80\x99s? The Equifax C.E.O.\xe2\x80\x99s (for a cybersecurity breach) or Papa John\xe2\x80\x99s (for a racial slur)? Awkwafina\xe2\x80\x99s (for cultural appropriation) or Lena Dunham\xe2\x80\x99s (for Lord knows what)? At SorryWatch.com and @SorryWatch, Susan McCarthy and Marjorie Ingall have been judging the adequacy of apologies and welcoming \xe2\x80\x9csuggestions for shaming\xe2\x80\x9d since 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of awful apologies out there,\xe2\x80\x9d the SorryWatchers write. \xe2\x80\x9cApologies that make things worse, not better. Apologies that miss the point. Apologies that are really self-defense dressed up as an apology. Apologies that add insult to injury. Apologies that are worse than the original offense. Apologies so bad people should apologize for them.\xe2\x80\x9d McCarthy and Ingall are releasing a new book next year, \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, Sorry, Sorry: The Case for Good Apologies.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, on their Web site they\xe2\x80\x99ve got rules\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSix steps to a good apology\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and categories for classifying defective ones: \xe2\x80\x9cBe VEEERY CAAAREFUL if you want to provide explanation; don\xe2\x80\x99t let it shade into excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d Heaven forfend.\xe2\x80\x9cLeast said, soonest mended\xe2\x80\x9d is advice from another century, candle and quill, ox and cart. This past March, the day after Will Smith smacked Chris Rock at the Oscars and failed to apologize to him during his acceptance speech, he apologized on his Instagram account: \xe2\x80\x9cI was out of line and I was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d Twitter blew its top! \xe2\x80\x9cThis is bullshit,\xe2\x80\x9d one guy tweeted. \xe2\x80\x9cAny normal person is in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d Plainly, the Instapology was insufficient. In July, Smith apologized again, in a nearly six-minute video in which he looked as harried and trapped as Steve Carell in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Patient,\xe2\x80\x9d a prisoner in a basement rec room. \xe2\x80\x9cDisappointing people is my central trauma,\xe2\x80\x9d Smith said into the camera or, actually, multiple cameras. \xe2\x80\x9cI am trying to be remorseful without being ashamed of myself, right?\xe2\x80\x9d Twitter blew its top! It was either not enough or, oh, my God, please stop. One online viewer sympathized: \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally me when my mom forces me to apologize to my siblings.\xe2\x80\x9d As for Chris Rock, he reportedly said, onstage, \xe2\x80\x9cFuck your hostage video.\xe2\x80\x9d By then, Twitter was blowing its top about something else.It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to blow your top, God knows. If you\xe2\x80\x99re being treated like crap, and nothing you\xe2\x80\x99ve tried has put a stop to it, or if the former President of the United States keeps on saying horrible, wretched things, and you notice that some rich nitwit is getting slammed on Twitter for doing the same thing that\xe2\x80\x99s been done to you, or for saying what the ex-President just said, it can feel good to watch that nitwit burn. But that feeling won\xe2\x80\x99t last. And when that nitwit apologizes it won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough. And the world will have become just a little bit rottener.Rating apologies and listing their shortcomings started out as a BuzzFeed kind of thing, and then it pretty quickly became a corporate kind of thing: human resources, leadership institutes, political consulting. In 2013, the Harvard Business Review published an essay on the Power Apology. Knowing how to apologize on Twitter became crucial to brand management. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say sorry, but knowing how to say it effectively on Twitter is an essential skill that both brands and celebrities should learn,\xe2\x80\x9d a communications manager advised not long afterward, offering nine lessons \xe2\x80\x9con the art of the Twitter apology.\xe2\x80\x9d You could do it well, or you could do it badly. Likely, this could be quantified: you\xe2\x80\x99d see it in the price of your stock, the number of your Twitter followers, or the percentage change in your Netflix viewership. As of 2022, even Forbes rates apologies. It seldom helps your vote count, though: politicians who apologize tend to suffer the consequences, which is why they generally brazen these things out.It\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to say you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry when you screw up, and to say it well, and to mean it, and to try to make amends. But are people getting worse at that? Or are celebrity publicists, political advisers, corporate lawyers, higher-ed administrators, and media-relations departments just avoiding lawsuits, clearing profits, heading off student protests, and directing news stories by advising people to (a) demand apologies and (b) make them? \xe2\x80\x9cExamples of failed apologies are everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d the psychiatrist Aaron Lazare wrote in \xe2\x80\x9cOn Apology,\xe2\x80\x9d a book published not last week but nearly two decades ago. Distressed at a seeming explosion of cheap, showy, and insincere apologies, Lazare got curious about where they\xe2\x80\x99d all come from, like the day you find ants swarming your kitchen counter and yank open all the cupboards, exasperated. He dated what he called the \xe2\x80\x9capology phenomenon\xe2\x80\x9d to the nineteen-nineties, but he struggled to understand what had driven this change. He suspected that it may have been due, in part, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe increasing power and influence of women in society,\xe2\x80\x9d because women apologize a lot, he explained, and like to be apologized to. As far as I know, no one asked him to apologize for that comment. But if he\xe2\x80\x99d made it today he\xe2\x80\x99d be in the soup.Rituals of atonement and forgiveness lie at the heart of most religions, a testament to the human capacity for grace. On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Jews fast and pray and repent. Jesus brought this spirit to Christianity and taught his followers to pray to God to \xe2\x80\x9cforgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\xe2\x80\x9d The early Christian church developed what became the Sacrament of Reconciliation: confession, and penance. There are many steps to atonement in Islam, from admitting a wrong to making restitution and asking for God\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness. Jews, Christians, and Muslims make themselves right with God. Buddhists, who worship no god, make themselves right with other people. Hindus practice Prayaschitta, rituals of absolution. Mainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s the forgiveness and the atonement that matter.Apology, though, has a different history. You can confess without apologizing and you can apologize without confessing, and this might be because, historically, an apology is a justification\xe2\x80\x94a defense, not a confession. As the philosopher Nick Smith pointed out in \xe2\x80\x9cI Was Wrong\xe2\x80\x9d (2008), the word \xe2\x80\x9capology,\xe2\x80\x9d in English, didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest a statement of regret until around the sixteenth century, when, in Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRichard III,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckingham begs Richard\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, for interrupting his prayers, and Richard says, \xe2\x80\x9cThere needs no such apology.\xe2\x80\x9d Medieval Christians practiced what the historian Thomas\xc2\xa0N. Tentler called \xe2\x80\x9ca theology of consolation,\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of four elements\xe2\x80\x94sorrow, confession, penitence, and absolution\xe2\x80\x94whose purpose was reconciliation with God and with the body of the faithful. In \xe2\x80\x9cForgiveness: An Alternative Account,\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew Ichihashi Potts, a professor of Christian morals at Harvard Divinity School, offers what he calls \xe2\x80\x9ca modest theological defense of forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d His argument follows that of the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who, in \xe2\x80\x9cAnger and Forgiveness\xe2\x80\x9d (2016), argued that forgiveness isn\xe2\x80\x99t salutary for either party if, in order to give it, you insist on an apology. Potts calls this \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy of apology.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not better than vengeance, since to demand an apology and to delight in the offender\xe2\x80\x99s grovelling is vengeance by another name. His evidence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come from Twitter; it comes mainly from novels, including Marilynne Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGilead\xe2\x80\x9d and Toni Morrison\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBeloved.\xe2\x80\x9d Forgiveness, for Potts, is not an exchange\xe2\x80\x94forgiveness granted in return for the opportunity to witness a spectacle of abasement and self-loathing\xe2\x80\x94but a promise not to retaliate. Demanding an apology in exchange for forgiveness can never constitute healing, or deliver justice; it is, instead, a pleasure taken by people who delight in witnessing the suffering of those in their power (if only briefly). There is no such thing as a failed apology, then, only an abuse of power, because all forgiveness, Potts writes, \xe2\x80\x9cbegins and ends in failure\xe2\x80\x9d: it does not, and cannot, redeem or undo pain and loss; it can only demand the necessary attention to pain and loss, as a reckoning, as an act of grief. Forgiveness is, therefore, a species of mourning, a form of sorrow.Within the early Christian West, acts of public supplication\xe2\x80\x94begging pardon\xe2\x80\x94required confession and might require restitution, but not the scripted public apology in the sense the SorryWatchers want. The same distinction can be made within the history of Judaism. In the twelfth century, the Spanish-born Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, known as Maimonides, wrote a commentary on the Torah and the Talmud that included a section on teshuvah, or \xe2\x80\x9crepentance,\xe2\x80\x9d an extended reflection on the commandment that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sinner should repent of his sin before God and confess.\xe2\x80\x9d But, as the Jewish historian Henry Abramson remarked in a recent study, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ways of Repentance,\xe2\x80\x9d Maimonides warned against public confession that \xe2\x80\x9ccan also be an expression of personal arrogance: \xe2\x80\x98Look how good I am at doing teshuvah!\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Watch my apology video on YouTube!In \xe2\x80\x9cOn Repentance and Repair: Making Amends in an Unapologetic World,\xe2\x80\x9d the rabbi Danya Ruttenberg translates Maimonides into a step-by-step guide for our world, for which she provides modern-day examples. The first step is \xe2\x80\x9cnaming and owning harm\xe2\x80\x9d (one of her examples: \xe2\x80\x9cI finally understand how my decision to hold a writer\xe2\x80\x99s retreat at a plantation sanitizes the horrors of slavery\xe2\x80\x9d); the second is \xe2\x80\x9cstarting to change.\xe2\x80\x9d Step three: restitution. Step four: apology. Step five: making different choices. These are kindhearted ideas, and Ruttenberg\xe2\x80\x99s book is full of hope and counsel about repair through restitution. But her prescriptions also come close to insisting on the suppression of dissent. She says that \xe2\x80\x9cstarting to change,\xe2\x80\x9d for Maimonides, might have involved \xe2\x80\x9ctearful supplication,\xe2\x80\x9d but that \xe2\x80\x9cthese days this process of change might also involve therapy, or rehab, or educating oneself rigorously on an issue about which one had been ignorant or held toxic opinions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cThis book started on Twitter,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruttenberg writes, which is something of a tip-off. \xe2\x80\x9cTwitter gamifies communication,\xe2\x80\x9d the philosopher C.\xc2\xa0Thi Nguyen has argued; it\xe2\x80\x99s custom-built to do things like score apologies, to drag users into a rating system that has nothing to do with morality. An unforgiving god rules Twitter, where the modern economy of apology runs something like this: If you express what I believe to be a toxic or ignorant opinion, you must apologize according to my rules for apology. If you do, I may forgive you. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I will punish you, and damn you unto eternity.The practice of establishing and enforcing strict requirements for public apology is not a human universal. It happens only here and there, and now and again. You see it in fiercely sectarian times and places\xe2\x80\x94like twenty-first-century social media, or seventeenth-century New England.Consider a case from October, 1665, when the Massachusetts legislature assembled in Boston to attend to a docket of ordinary affairs, a day in the life of a puritanical theocracy. It set the price of grain: wheat, five shillings a bushel; barley, four shillings sixpence; corn, three shillings. It addressed a petition filed by three Native men, including the Pennacook sachem Wanalancet, regarding an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s claim to an island on the Merrimack River. It warned one unhappy, estranged couple, Mr. and Mrs. William Tilley, that he must \xe2\x80\x9cprovide for hir as his wife, & that shee submit hirselfe to him as she ought,\xe2\x80\x9d or else he would be fined and she would be imprisoned. In honor of God\xe2\x80\x99s having graced the colony with abundant rain during the summer and mercifully diverted a fleet of Dutch ships from an invasion, the legislature appointed November 8th \xe2\x80\x9cto be kept in solemn thanksgiving,\xe2\x80\x9d but, because a plague was still raging in London, a sign of God\xe2\x80\x99s wrath, it declared November 22nd \xe2\x80\x9ca solem day of humilliation.\xe2\x80\x9d And it condemned five men who had dared to practice a heretical religion, Baptism, at which announcement one colonist, Zeckaryah Roads, blurted out \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Court had not to doe wth matters of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d He was detained as a result.\xe2\x80\x9cAre. You. Ready. To. Weeeeave?\xe2\x80\x9dCartoon by Benjamin SchwartzCopy LinkCopyLinkLink copiedCartCartFor the things they said\xe2\x80\x94words whispered, grumbles muttered, prayers offered, curses shouted\xe2\x80\x94dissenters, blasphemers, and nonconformists in seventeenth-century New England faced censure, arrest, flogging, the pillory, disenfranchisement, exile, and even execution. Quakers might have their ears cut off. For holding toxic opinions, one blasphemer was sentenced to have the letter B \xe2\x80\x9ccutt out of ridd cloth & sowed to her vper garment on her right arme.\xe2\x80\x9d Those who wished to avoid or mitigate these consequences might apologize in public. Mostly, apologies followed a script. The Six Steps to a Good Apology! Disappointing People Is My Central Trauma: How to Avoid the Eight Worst Apologies of 1665! Earlier that year, just months before Zeckaryah Roads dared to voice dissent, Major William Hathorne, of Salem\xe2\x80\x94an ancestor of Nathaniel Hawthorne\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94issued a public apology for his own (now lost to history) error: \xe2\x80\x9cI freely confesse, that I spake many words rashly, foolishly, & unadvisedly, of wch I am ashamed, & repent me of them, & desire all that tooke offence to forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d That did the trick. You went off script at your peril, as the historian Jane Kamensky demonstrated in her masterly book \xe2\x80\x9cGoverning the Tongue\xe2\x80\x9d (1997). In the sixteen-forties, observers deemed Ann Hibbins\xe2\x80\x99s apology\xe2\x80\x94essentially, for being abrasive, and a woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cvery Leane, & thin, & poore, & sparinge.\xe2\x80\x9d It saved her neck, but not for long: in 1656, Hibbins was hanged to death as a witch. Still, there was one other option: after John Farnham refused to apologize for countenancing heresy, and was therefore banished, he said the day he was kicked out of the church \xe2\x80\x9cwas the best day that ever dawned upon him.\xe2\x80\x9d I mean, fuck it, there was always Rhode Island.Lately, online, you can find modern apologies ranked by the same standards once so punctiliously applied by Puritan divines. \xe2\x80\x9cI doe now in the presence of god & this reverand assemblage freely acknowledg my evell,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry Sewall confessed in a church near Ipswich in 1651, although, as he pointed out, he\xe2\x80\x99d been forced to make that apology \xe2\x80\x9cas part of ye sentence\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99d been given by the Ipswich court. He squeaked by with that one, but just barely. Modern SorryWatchers might rate it Garrison Keillorian.In 1665, for intimating that the government ought not to banish people for being Baptists, or kill them for being Quakers, Zeckaryah Roads did what he had to do, as chronicled in the meeting records, \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledging his fault, & declaring he was sorry he had given them any offence, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d Easy to say from here, of course, but I wish to hell he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.The twenty-first-century culture of public apology has its origins in the best of intentions and the noblest of actions: people seeking collective justice without violence for terrible, unimaginable acts of brutality, monstrous wickedness, crimes against humanity itself. In the aftermath of the Second World War, churches and nation-states began issuing apologies for wartime atrocities and historical injustices. Some of the abiding principles that lie behind this postwar wave of collective apologies also found expression in \xe2\x80\x9crestorative justice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94individuals making amends to their victims, sometimes as an alternative to incarceration or other kinds of force and violence. The idea gained influence in the nineteen-seventies, when it intersected with the victims-rights movement, and its particular demands for apology as remedy. And you can easily see why. Prosecutors\xe2\x80\x94for years, decades, centuries\xe2\x80\x94had failed to act on allegations of sexual misconduct, had ignored or suppressed evidence of police brutality and predatory policing; in a thousand ways, the criminal-justice system had failed women and children, had failed the poor and people of color. For some, \xe2\x80\x9crestorative justice\xe2\x80\x9d held out the prospect of a better path. By the nineteen-nineties, schools and juvenile-justice systems had begun using restorative-justice methods, often requiring, of public-school students, public apologies. Meanwhile, in the United States, church membership was falling from around seventy-five per cent in 1945 to less than fifty per cent by 2020. In many quarters, public acts began taking the place of religious ritual, political ideologies replacing religious faith. The national public apology took on the gravity and solemnity of a secular sacrament: Ronald Reagan apologizing, in 1988, for the imprisonment of more than a hundred thousand Japanese Americans during the Second World War (and providing limited reparations); David Cameron apologizing, in 2010, for Bloody Sunday; or the Prime Ministers of Canada apologizing, in 2008 and 2017, for the practice of taking Indigenous children from their homes and confining them to schools where, maltreated, neglected, and abused, they suffered and died.Apology came to play a role, too, in therapy, including family therapy, in twelve-step recovery programs, and in H.R. dispute-resolution procedures. Conventions that were established for heads of states and churches making public apologies to entire peoples against whom they had committed atrocities came to be applied to apologies from one individual to another, for everything from violent crime to petty insult. The person became the collective. Eve Ensler\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Apology,\xe2\x80\x9d in which she imagines the apology her father never offered for sexually abusing her, is dedicated to \xe2\x80\x9cevery woman still waiting for an apology.\xe2\x80\x9d The particular injury became the universal harm. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all cause harm,\xe2\x80\x9d Danya Ruttenberg writes in her book on repentance. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have all been harmed.\xe2\x80\x9dBut the origins of the Twitter apology orgy lie elsewhere, too, and especially in the idea that many kinds of speech can be harm, a conviction central to the brand of feminism founded in the nineteen-nineties by the legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon. (Her book \xe2\x80\x9cOnly Words\xe2\x80\x9d was published in 1993.) In 2004, in \xe2\x80\x9cOn Apology,\xe2\x80\x9d Aaron Lazare tried to figure out when the number of public apologies began to explode. He counted and identified a rise in the number of newspaper articles about apologizing, beginning his analysis in the early nineteen-nineties and identifying a peak in 1997-98. He found this puzzling. But, historically, it makes sense: his chronology nicely lines up with Anita Hill\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at the Clarence Thomas hearings, in 1991, and with the breaking of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, in 1998. Thomas maintained his innocence, and although Clinton went on television later that year and admitted to the relationship, many viewers found his apology inadequate. And neither man seemed sorry, either, except insofar as they both quite plainly felt very, very sorry for themselves.The refusal of Thomas and Clinton to apologize for the ways in which they had harmed women took place on television. And the whole spectacle, with its scripted expectation of apology and contrition, drew its sensibility from television. In the nineteen-eighties and nineties, the stock soap-opera plotline\xe2\x80\x94betrayal, hurt feelings, and misunderstanding followed by tearful apology, reconciliation, and reunion\xe2\x80\x94became a hallmark of the daytime talk-show circuit. Oprah and Phil Donahue staged churchy apologies in front of studio audiences, choreographed for maximum emotional intensity, and advancing the idea that every possible political, economic, or social injustice, from child abuse to police brutality and employment discrimination, could be addressed by a two-shot, a few closeups, and Kleenex. Donahue mounted an especially perverse sorrywatching spectacle in 1993. The year before, after a jury acquitted four Los Angeles policemen who beat Rodney King and riots broke out in angry, anguished protest, a group of Black men pulled Reginald\xc2\xa0O. Denny, a white man, out of his truck and beat him nearly to death. Henry Keith Watson, charged with attempted murder, was found not guilty, and was convicted only of misdemeanor assault. After Watson got out of jail, Donahue brought Denny and Watson together in front of an almost entirely white audience for a two-part apology special. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sorry?\xe2\x80\x9d Donahue asked Watson, again and again, as the audience grew tense and even tenser. \xe2\x80\x9cI apologize for my participation in the injuries you suffered,\xe2\x80\x9d Watson said to Denny. Then Watson eyed the audience: \xe2\x80\x9cIs everybody happy now?\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody was not.Demanding public apologies on daytime television and deeming those apologies insufficient was an occasional thumb-wrestling match between two seven-year-olds sitting on a green vinyl school-bus seat on the ride to second grade compared with the daily, Roman Colosseum-style slaughtering that takes place online. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that people don\xe2\x80\x99t do and say terrible things for which they ought to atone. They do. Some of those things are crimes. Many are slights. Very many are utterly trivial. A few are almost unspeakably evil. But, on Twitter at its worst, all harm is equal, all apologies are spectacles, and hardly anyone is ever forgiven.In 2017, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Matt Damon tried to rate harm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an interview on ABC News. \xe2\x80\x9cThey shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be conflated, right?\xe2\x80\x9d At that, Minnie Driver tweeted her ire, and later told the Guardian, \xe2\x80\x9cHow about: it\xe2\x80\x99s all fucking wrong and it\xe2\x80\x99s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\xe2\x80\x99s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not.\xe2\x80\x9d Damon apologized, and said that he\xe2\x80\x99d learned to \xe2\x80\x9cclose my mouth.\xe2\x80\x9dIn 1993, Phil Donahue seemed to think that, by asking Henry Keith Watson to apologize to Reginald Denny in that studio, he was bravely addressing the problem of racism in America. Twenty years from now, what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening on Twitter will likely look exactly as grotesque and cruel and ineffective as that two-part, syndicated apology special. Will Donald Trump or anyone in his inner circle ever apologize for anything\xe2\x80\x94for tearing toddlers from their parents\xe2\x80\x99 arms, for inciting neo-Nazis, for grift, fraud, sedition? Never. Will responding to the gaffe of the day by demanding a six-step apology usher in an age of justice for all, or an end to iniquity? No. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason Puritanism did not prevail in America; it tends to backfire. In 2018, during an exchange on Twitter, the television writer Dan Harmon apologized for sexually harassing the writer Megan Ganz, and then made a heartfelt video, elaborating. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re living in a good time right now, because we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get away with it anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to sexual misconduct. And I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s true. But very little evidence suggests that calling people out on Twitter, self-righteous indignation followed by cynical apology, is making the world a better place, and much suggests that the opposite is true, that Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s pious mercilessness is generating nothing so much as a new and bitter remorselessness.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t give a fuck, \xe2\x80\x99cause Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s not a real place,\xe2\x80\x9d Dave Chappelle said last fall, in his Netflix special \xe2\x80\x9cThe Closer.\xe2\x80\x9d In June, on the Amazon Prime series \xe2\x80\x9cThe Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d a made-for-television Captain America-style superhero named Homelander, who is secretly a villain, recited a rehearsed apology on television, only to unsay it later, in an unscripted outburst. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not some weak-kneed fucking crybaby that goes around fucking apologizing all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, seething. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done. I am done apologizing.\xe2\x80\x9d Around the time the episode appeared, the actor who plays Homelander, Antony Starr, who was found guilty of assault and released on probation, told the Times, unabjectly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou mess up. You own it. You learn from it.\xe2\x80\x9d No \xe2\x80\x9cI am listening,\xe2\x80\x9d no \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to rehab.\xe2\x80\x9d None of it. It was as if he got away with going off-script because his character already had. And Homelander won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last to make that \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done\xe2\x80\x9d speech. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m done saying I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Jones yelled in a courtroom in September during a trial to assess the money he\xe2\x80\x99ll be required to pay the parents of very young children who were killed in a mass shooting, a shooting that Jones has for years insisted never happened, because those children, he told his audience, never existed. Jones has been found liable for defamation. Even the hundreds of millions of dollars in damages he was ordered to pay to the families whose despair he worsened, and on whose affliction he feasted, goes nowhere near far enough. And neither does any apology.Twitter is blowing its top, some very angry people very loudly demanding apologies while other very angry people demand the denunciation of the people who are demanding apologies. Dangerously, but predictably, the split seems to have become partisan, as if to apologize were progressive, to forget conservative. The fracture widens and hardens\xe2\x80\x94fanatic, schismatic, idiotic. But another way of thinking about what a culture of forced, performed remorse has wrought is not, or not only, that it has elevated wrath and loathing but that it has demeaned sorrow, grief, and consolation. No apology can cover that crime, nor mend that loss.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x99\xa6Published in the print edition of the November 14, 2022, issue, with the headline \xe2\x80\x9cSorry Spectacle.\xe2\x80\x9dNew Yorker FavoritesLive midterms reporting and analysis by New Yorker writers across the country.Our live results map will update until the last vote is counted.What integration was like at a state university.Agatha Christie and the golden age of poisons.In a moment of failure, a dejected writer began sending e-mails to Jeb Bush.From 2017: why facts don\xe2\x80\x99t change our minds.Sign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker.Jill Lepore, a staff writer at The New Yorker, is a professor of history at Harvard.

62,The Centipede’s Dilemma (wikipedia.org),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centipede%27s_Dilemma,108,"b'The Centipede\'s Dilemma - Wikipedia The Centipede\'s Dilemma From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Tendency to misexecuted routinized tasks if one tries to execute them consciously ""The Centipede\'s Dilemma"" is a short poem that has lent its name to a psychological effect called the centipede effect or centipede syndrome. The centipede effect occurs when a normally automatic or unconscious activity is disrupted by consciousness of it or reflection on it. For example, a golfer thinking too closely about their swing or someone thinking too much about how they knot their tie may find their performance of the task impaired. The effect is also known as hyperreflection or Humphrey\'s law[1] after English psychologist George Humphrey (1889\xe2\x80\x931966), who propounded it in 1923. As he wrote of the poem, ""This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us"". The effect is the reverse of a solvitur ambulando. Contents 1 Poem 2 In psychology and philosophy 3 Cultural references 4 See also 5 References Poem[edit] The short poem is usually attributed to Katherine Craster (1841\xe2\x80\x931874)[1] in Pinafore Poems, 1871.[2] By 1881, it had begun appearing in journals such as The Spectator[3] and Littell\'s Living Age.[4] On May 23, 1889, the poem appeared in an article by British zoologist Ray Lankester, published in the scientific journal Nature,[5] which discussed the work of photographer Eadweard Muybridge in capturing the motion of animals: ""For my own part,"" wrote Lankester, ""I should greatly like to apply Mr. Muybridge\'s cameras, or a similar set of batteries, to the investigation of a phenomenon more puzzling even than that of \'the galloping horse\'. I allude to the problem of \'the running centipede\'"". Lankester finished the article on a fanciful note by imagining the ""disastrous results in the way of perplexity"" that could result from such an investigation, quoting the poem and mentioning that the author was unknown to him or to the friend who sent it to him. It has since been variously attributed to specific authors, but without convincing evidence, and often appears under the title ""The Centipede\'s Dilemma"". The version in the article is: A centipede was happy \xe2\x80\x93 quite! Until a toad in fun Said, ""Pray, which leg moves after which?"" This raised her doubts to such a pitch, She fell exhausted in the ditch Not knowing how to run. In psychology and philosophy[edit] English psychologist George Humphrey (1889\xe2\x80\x931966) referred to the tale in his 1923 book The Story of Man\'s Mind:[6] ""No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work"", he wrote. ""If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled"". He went on to recount the centipede\'s story, commenting, ""This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us, for exactly the same thing happens if we pay conscious attention to any well-formed habit, such as walking"". Thus, his eponymous ""Humphrey\'s law"" states that once a task has become automatized, conscious thought about the task, while performing it, impairs performance.[7] Whereas habit diminishes and then eliminates the attention required for routine tasks, this automaticity is disrupted by attention to a normally unconscious competence. In 1994, philosopher Karl Popper referred to the centipede effect in his book Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction:[8] ""if we have learnt certain movements so that they have sunk below the level of conscious control, then if we try to follow them consciously, we very often interfere with them so badly that we stop them"". He gives the example of violinist Adolf Busch, who was asked by fellow violinist Bronis\xc5\x82aw Huberman how he played a certain passage of Beethoven\'s violin concerto. Busch told Huberman that it was quite simple, and then found that he could no longer play the passage. In 1996, psychiatric psychoanalyst Theo L. Dorpat compares questions and interventions irrelevant to the patient\'s current thought process during psychotherapy in his book Gaslighting to ""the story of the centipede who became disorganized and unable to walk after he was asked, \'What\'s wrong with your 34th left foot?\'.""[9] Cultural references[edit] Cover of The Hot Soldier and Other Stories by Gustav Meyrink In 1903, Simplicissimus magazine printed an adaptation of the story ""The Curse of The Toad"" (Der Fluch der Kr\xc3\xb6te) by the Austrian author Gustav Meyrink. The fable was also published in Meyrink\'s 1903 collection of tales, The Hot Soldier and Other Stories.[10] Spider Robinson\'s short story ""The Centipede\'s Dilemma"", one in his story-sequence book ""Callahan\'s Crosstime Saloon"", concerns a psychic who uses instinctive telekinetic powers to cheat at darts, and is foiled when another character triggers hyperreflection in him.

Kouzou Sakai for Quanta Magazine By Charlie WoodStaff WriterNovember 17, 2022View PDF/Print Modecosmologydark energymultiversephysicstheoretical physicsthermodynamicsAll topicsIntroductionCosmologists have spent decades striving to understand why our universe is so stunningly vanilla. Not only is it smooth and flat as far as we can see, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also expanding at an ever-so-slowly increasing pace, when na\xc3\xafve calculations suggest that \xe2\x80\x94 coming out of the Big Bang \xe2\x80\x94 space should have become crumpled up by gravity and blasted apart by repulsive dark energy. To explain the cosmos\xe2\x80\x99s flatness, physicists have added a dramatic opening chapter to cosmic history: They propose that space rapidly inflated like a balloon at the start of the Big Bang, ironing out any curvature. And to explain the gentle growth of space following that initial spell of inflation, some have argued that our universe is just one among many less hospitable universes in a giant multiverse. But now, two physicists have turned the conventional thinking about our vanilla universe on its head. Following a line of research started by Stephen Hawking and Gary Gibbons in 1977, the duo has published a new calculation suggesting that the plainness of the cosmos is expected, rather than rare. Our universe is the way it is, according to Neil Turok of the University of Edinburgh and Latham Boyle of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, for the same reason that air spreads evenly throughout a room: Weirder options are conceivable, but exceedingly improbable. The universe \xe2\x80\x9cmay seem extremely fine-tuned, extremely unlikely, but [they\xe2\x80\x99re] saying, \xe2\x80\x98Wait a minute, it\xe2\x80\x99s the favored one,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Thomas Hertog, a cosmologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a novel contribution that uses different methods compared to what most people have been doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steffen Gielen, a cosmologist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. The provocative conclusion rests on a mathematical trick involving switching to a clock that ticks with imaginary numbers. Using the imaginary clock, as Hawking did in the \xe2\x80\x9970s, Turok and Boyle could calculate a quantity, known as entropy, that appears to correspond to our universe. But the imaginary time trick is a roundabout way of calculating entropy, and without a more rigorous method, the meaning of the quantity remains hotly debated. While physicists puzzle over the correct interpretation of the entropy calculation, many view it as a new guidepost on the road to the fundamental, quantum nature of space and time. \xe2\x80\x9cSomehow,\xe2\x80\x9d Gielen said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s giving us a window into perhaps seeing the microstructure of space-time.\xe2\x80\x9d Imaginary Paths Turok and Boyle, frequent collaborators, are renowned for devising creative and unorthodox ideas about cosmology. Last year, to study how likely our universe may be, they turned to a technique developed in the 1940s by the physicist Richard Feynman. Aiming to capture the probabilistic behavior of particles, Feynman imagined that a particle explores all possible routes linking start to finish: a straight line, a curve, a loop, ad infinitum. He devised a way to give each path a number related to its likelihood and add all the numbers up. This \xe2\x80\x9cpath integral\xe2\x80\x9d technique became a powerful framework for predicting how any quantum system would most likely behave. As soon as Feynman started publicizing the path integral, physicists spotted a curious connection with thermodynamics, the venerable science of temperature and energy. It was this bridge between quantum theory and thermodynamics that enabled Turok and Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s calculation.

Gabriela Secara/Perimeter Institute IntroductionThermodynamics leverages the power of statistics so that you can use just a few numbers to describe a system of many parts, such as the gajillion air molecules rattling around in a room. Temperature, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 essentially the average speed of air molecules \xe2\x80\x94 gives a rough sense of the room\xe2\x80\x99s energy. Overall properties like temperature and pressure describe a \xe2\x80\x9cmacrostate\xe2\x80\x9d of the room. But a macrostate is a crude account; air molecules can be arranged in a tremendous number of ways that all correspond to the same macrostate. Nudge one oxygen atom a bit to the left, and the temperature won\xe2\x80\x99t budge. Each unique microscopic configuration is known as a microstate,\xc2\xa0 and the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate determines its entropy. Entropy gives physicists a sharp way of comparing the odds of different outcomes: The higher the entropy of a macrostate, the more likely it is. There are vastly more ways for air molecules to arrange themselves throughout the whole room than if they\xe2\x80\x99re bunched up in a corner, for instance. As a result, one expects air molecules to spread out (and stay spread out). The self-evident truth that probable outcomes are probable, couched in the language of physics, becomes the famous second law of thermodynamics: that the total entropy of a system tends to grow. The resemblance to the path integral was unmistakable: In thermodynamics, you add up all possible configurations of a system. And with the path integral, you add up all possible paths a system can take. There\xe2\x80\x99s just one rather glaring distinction: Thermodynamics deals in probabilities, which are positive numbers that straightforwardly add together. But in the path integral, the number assigned to each path is complex, meaning that it involves the imaginary number i, the square root of \xe2\x88\x921. Complex numbers can grow or shrink when added together \xe2\x80\x94 allowing them to capture the wavelike nature of quantum particles, which can combine or cancel out. Yet physicists found that a simple transformation can take you from one realm to the other. Make time imaginary (a move known as a Wick rotation after the Italian physicist Gian Carlo Wick), and a second i enters the path integral that snuffs out the first one, turning imaginary numbers into real probabilities. Replace the time variable with the inverse of temperature, and you get a well-known thermodynamic equation. This Wick trick led to a blockbuster finding by Hawking and Gibbons in 1977, at the end of a whirlwind series of theoretical discoveries about space and time. The Entropy of Space-Time Decades earlier, Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s general theory of relativity had revealed that space and time together form a unified fabric of reality \xe2\x80\x94 space-time \xe2\x80\x94 and that the force of gravity is really the tendency for objects to follow the folds in space-time. In extreme circumstances, space-time can curve steeply enough to create an inescapable Alcatraz known as a black hole. In 1973, Jacob Bekenstein advanced the heresy that black holes are imperfect cosmic prisons. He reasoned that the abysses should absorb the entropy of their meals, rather than deleting that entropy from the universe and violating the second law of thermodynamics. But if black holes have entropy, they must also have temperatures and must radiate heat. A skeptical Stephen Hawking tried to prove Bekenstein wrong, embarking on an intricate calculation of how quantum particles behave in the curved space-time of a black hole. To his surprise, in 1974 he found that black holes do indeed radiate. Another calculation confirmed Bekenstein\xe2\x80\x99s guess: A black hole has entropy equal to one-quarter the area of its event horizon \xe2\x80\x94 the point of no return for an infalling object. The late British physicist Stephen Hawking, pictured in 1979 in Princeton, New Jersey. Santi Visalli/Getty Images IntroductionIn the years that followed, the British physicists Gibbons and Malcolm Perry, and later Gibbons and Hawking, arrived at the same result from another direction. They set up a path integral, in principle adding up all the different ways space-time might bend to make a black hole. Next, they Wick-rotated the black hole, marking the flow of time with imaginary numbers, and scrutinized its shape. They discovered that, in the imaginary time direction, the black hole periodically returned to its initial state. This Groundhog Day-like repetition in imaginary time gave the black hole a sort of stasis that allowed them to calculate its temperature and entropy. They might not have trusted the results if the answers had not precisely matched those calculated earlier by Bekenstein and Hawking. By the end of the decade, their collective work had yielded a startling notion: The entropy of black holes implied that space-time itself is made of tiny, rearrangeable pieces, much as air is made of molecules. And miraculously, even without knowing what these \xe2\x80\x9cgravitational atoms\xe2\x80\x9d were, physicists could count their arrangements by looking at a black hole in imaginary time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that result which left a deep, deep impression on Hawking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hertog, Hawking\xe2\x80\x99s former graduate student and longtime collaborator. Hawking immediately wondered if the Wick rotation would work for more than just black holes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that geometry captures a quantum property of a black hole,\xe2\x80\x9d Hertog said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it\xe2\x80\x99s irresistible to do the same with the cosmological properties of the whole universe.\xe2\x80\x9d Counting All Possible Universes Right away, Hawking and Gibbons Wick-rotated one of the simplest imaginable universes \xe2\x80\x94 one containing nothing but the dark energy built into space itself. This empty, expanding universe, called a \xe2\x80\x9cde Sitter\xe2\x80\x9d space-time, has a horizon, beyond which space expands so quickly that no signal from there will ever reach an observer in the center of the space. In 1977, Gibbons and Hawking calculated that, like a black hole, a de Sitter universe also has an entropy equal to one-fourth its horizon\xe2\x80\x99s area. Again, space-time seemed to have a countable number of microstates. But the entropy of the actual universe remained an open question. Our universe is not empty; it brims with radiating light and streams of galaxies and dark matter. Light drove a brisk expansion of space during the universe\xe2\x80\x99s youth, then the gravitational attraction of matter slowed things to a crawl during cosmic adolescence. Now dark energy appears have taken over, driving a runaway expansion. \xe2\x80\x9cThat expansion history is a bumpy ride,\xe2\x80\x9d Hertog said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get an explicit solution is not so easy.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the last year or so, Boyle and Turok have built just such an explicit solution. First, in January, while playing with toy cosmologies, they noticed that adding radiation to de Sitter space-time didn\xe2\x80\x99t spoil the simplicity required to Wick-rotate the universe. Then over the summer they discovered that the technique would withstand even the messy inclusion of matter. The mathematical curve describing the more complicated expansion history still fell into a particular group of easy-to-handle functions, and the world of thermodynamics remained accessible. \xe2\x80\x9cThis Wick rotation is murky business when you move away from very symmetric space-time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guilherme Leite Pimentel, a cosmologist at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, Italy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they managed to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d By Wick-rotating the roller-coaster expansion history of a more realistic class of universes, they got a more versatile equation for cosmic entropy. For a wide range of cosmic macrostates defined by radiation, matter, curvature and a dark energy density (much as a range of temperatures and pressures define different possible environments of a room), the formula spits out the number of corresponding microstates. Turok and Boyle posted their results online in early October. Latham Boyle, a physicist and cosmologist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, coauthored a new calculation about the relative likelihoods of different universes. Gabriela Secara/Perimeter Institute IntroductionExperts have praised the explicit, quantitative result. But from their entropy equation, Boyle and Turok have drawn an unconventional conclusion about the nature of our universe. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where it becomes a little more interesting, and a little more controversial,\xe2\x80\x9d Hertog said. Boyle and Turok believe the equation conducts a census of all conceivable cosmic histories. Just as a room\xe2\x80\x99s entropy counts all the ways of arranging the air molecules for a given temperature, they suspect their entropy counts all the ways one might jumble up the atoms of space-time and still end up with a universe with a given overall history, curvature and dark energy density. Boyle likens the process to surveying a gigantic sack of marbles, each a different universe. Those with negative curvature might be green. Those with tons of dark energy might be cat\xe2\x80\x99s-eyes, and so on. Their census reveals that the overwhelming majority of the marbles have just one color \xe2\x80\x94 blue, say \xe2\x80\x94 corresponding to one type of universe: one broadly like our own, with no appreciable curvature and just a touch of dark energy. Weirder types of cosmos are vanishingly rare. In other words, the strangely vanilla features of our universe that have motivated decades of theorizing about cosmic inflation and the multiverse may not be strange at all. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very intriguing result,\xe2\x80\x9d Hertog said. But \xe2\x80\x9cit raises more questions than it answers.\xe2\x80\x9d Counting Confusion Boyle and Turok have calculated an equation that counts universes. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made the striking observation that universes like ours seem to account for the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the conceivable cosmic options. But that\xe2\x80\x99s where the certainty ends. The duo make no attempt to explain what quantum theory of gravity and cosmology might make certain universes common or rare. Nor do they explain how our universe, with its particular configuration of microscopic parts, came into being. Ultimately, they view their calculation as more of a clue to which sorts of universes are preferred than anything close to a full theory of cosmology. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve used is a cheap trick to get the answer without knowing what the theory is,\xe2\x80\x9d Turok said. Their work also revitalizes a question that has gone unanswered since Gibbons and Hawking first kicked off the whole business of space-time entropy: What exactly are the microstates that the cheap trick is counting? \xe2\x80\x9cThe key thing here is to say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that entropy means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henry Maxfield, a physicist at Stanford University who studies quantum theories of gravity. At its heart, entropy encapsulates ignorance. For a gas made of molecules, for instance, physicists know the temperature \xe2\x80\x94 the average speed of particles \xe2\x80\x94 but not what every particle is doing; the gas\xe2\x80\x99s entropy reflects the number of options. After decades of theoretical work, physicists are converging on a similar picture for black holes. Many theorists now believe that the area of the horizon describes their ignorance of the stuff that\xe2\x80\x99s fallen in \xe2\x80\x94 all the ways of internally arranging the building blocks of the black hole to match its outward appearance. (Researchers still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the microstates actually are; ideas include configurations of the particles called gravitons or the strings of string theory.) But when it comes to the entropy of the universe, physicists feel less certain about where their ignorance even lies. In April, two theorists attempted to put cosmological entropy on a firmer mathematical footing. Ted Jacobson, a physicist at the University of Maryland renowned for deriving Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of gravity from black hole thermodynamics, and his graduate student Batoul Banihashemi explicitly defined the entropy of a (vacant, expanding) de Sitter universe. They adopted the perspective of an observer at the center. Their technique, which involved adding a fictitious surface between the central observer and the horizon, then shrinking the surface until it reached the central observer and disappeared, recovered the Gibbons and Hawking answer that entropy equals one-quarter of the horizon area. They concluded that the de Sitter entropy counts all possible microstates inside the horizon. Turok and Boyle calculate the same entropy as Jacobson and Banihashemi for an empty universe. But in their new calculation pertaining to a realistic universe filled with matter and radiation, they get a much larger number of microstates \xe2\x80\x94 proportional to volume and not area. Faced with this apparent clash, they speculate that the different entropies answer different questions: The smaller de Sitter entropy counts microstates of pure space-time bounded by a horizon, while they suspect their larger entropy counts all the microstates of a space-time filled with matter and energy, both inside and outside the horizon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the whole shebang,\xe2\x80\x9d Turok said. Ultimately, settling the question of what Boyle and Turok are counting will require a more explicit mathematical definition of the ensemble of microstates, analogous to what Jacobson and Banihashemi have done for de Sitter space. Banihashemi said she views Boyle and Turok\xe2\x80\x99s entropy calculation \xe2\x80\x9cas an answer to a question that is yet to be fully understood.\xe2\x80\x9d As for more established answers to the question \xe2\x80\x9cWhy this universe?,\xe2\x80\x9d cosmologists say inflation and the multiverse are far from dead. Modern inflation theory, in particular, has come to solve more than just the universe\xe2\x80\x99s smoothness and flatness. Observations of the sky match many of its other predictions. Turok and Boyle\xe2\x80\x99s entropic argument has passed a notable first test, Pimentel said, but it will have to nail other, more detailed data to more seriously rival inflation. As befits a quantity that measures ignorance, mysteries rooted in entropy have served as harbingers of unknown physics before. In the late 1800s, a precise understanding of entropy in terms of microscopic arrangements helped confirm the existence of atoms. Today, the hope is that if the researchers calculating cosmological entropy in different ways can work out exactly what questions they\xe2\x80\x99re answering, those numbers will guide them toward a similar understanding of how Lego bricks of time and space pile up to create the universe that surrounds us. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat our calculation does is provide huge extra motivation for people who are trying to build microscopic theories of quantum gravity,\xe2\x80\x9d Turok said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause the prospect is that that theory will ultimately explain the large-scale geometry of the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d By Charlie WoodStaff WriterNovember 17, 2022View PDF/Print Modecosmologydark energymultiversephysicstheoretical physicsthermodynamicsAll topicsShare this articleFacebookTwitterCopied!Copy link EmailPocketRedditYcombinatorFlipboardNewsletterGet Quanta Magazine delivered to your inboxSubscribe nowRecent newslettersThe Quanta NewsletterGet highlights of the most important news delivered to your email inboxEmailSubscribeRecent newslettersComment on this articleQuanta Magazine moderates comments to\xc2\xa0facilitate an informed, substantive, civil conversation.

68,Go 1.21 may have a clear(x) builtin (utoronto.ca),https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoFutureClearBuiltin,91,"b""Chris's Wiki :: blog/programming/GoFutureClearBuiltin Chris Siebenmann :: CSpace \xc2\xbb blog \xc2\xbb programming \xc2\xbb GoFutureClearBuiltin Welcome, guest. Go 1.21 may have a clear(x) builtin and there's an interesting reason why November 18, 2022 Recently I noticed an interesting Go change in the development version, which adds type checking of a 'clear' builtin function. This was the first I'd heard of such a thing, but the CL had a helpful link to the Go issue, proposal: spec: add clear(x) builtin, to clear map, zero content of slice, ptr-to-array #56351. The title basically says what it's about, but it turns out that there's a surprising and interesting reason why Go sort of needs this. On the surface you might think that this wasn't an important change, because you can always do this by hand even for maps. While there's no built in way to clear a map, you can use a for loop: for k := range m { delete(m, k) } This for loop is less efficient than clearing a map in one operation, but it turns out that there is a subtle tricky issue that makes it not always work correctly. That issue is maps with floating point NaNs as keys (well, as the value of some keys). The moment a NaN is a key in your map, you can't delete it this way. (Really, you can see it in this playground example using math.NaN().) The cause of this issue with NaNs in maps is that Go follows the IEEE-754 standard for floating point comparison, and under this standard a NaN is never equal to anything, even another NaN or even itself. Although formally speaking delete() isn't defined in terms of specific key equality (in general maps don't quite specify things like that), in practice it works that way. Since delete() is implicitly based on key equality and NaNs never compare equal to each other, delete() can never remove key values that are NaNs, even if you got the key value from a 'range' over the map. Of course you're probably not going to deliberately use NaN as a key value in a map. But you may well use floating point values as keys, and NaNs might sneak into your floating point values in all sorts of ways. If they do, and you have code that clears a map this way, you're going to get a surprise (hopefully a relatively harmless one). There's no way to fix this without changing how maps with floating point keys handle NaNs, and even that opens up various questions. Adding a clear() builtin is more efficient and doesn't open up the NaN can of worms. This NaN issue was a surprise to me. Had you asked me before I'd read the proposal, I would have expected 'clear()' to be added only for efficiency and clarity. I had no idea there was also a correctness reason to have it. (While the current change will likely be in Go 1.20, a clear builtin likely won't appear until Go 1.21 at the earliest.) PS: If you suspect that this implies interesting and disturbing things for NaNs as key values in maps, you're correct. But that's for another entry. (2 comments.)

The Grid Resilience Innovative Partnership (GRIP) program and the Transmission Facilitation Program are funded by the Biden administration\xe2\x80\x99s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Together, the two programs represent\xc2\xa0the largest single direct federal investment in critical transmission and distribution infrastructure. It\xe2\x80\x99s also one of the first down payments on a more than $20 billion investment under the Biden administration\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Building a Better Grid Initiative. The White House also announced a $2.3 billion program that funds grid resilience investments by states and tribes to reduce impacts due to extreme weather and natural disasters. According to the DOE, independent estimates show that the US needs to expand electricity transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and may even need to triple current capacity by 2050 to accommodate a rapidly increasing supply of clean energy and meet growing power demand for EVs and electric home heating, as well as reduce power outages from severe weather due to climate change. US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said: With nearly 70% of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s grid more than 25 years old, the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda is making historic investments that will strengthen the nation\xe2\x80\x99s transmission grid to drive down energy costs, generate good-paying jobs, and help keep the lights on during extreme weather events.

Unless we all go off-grid, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not possible to move up the \xe2\x80\x9chierarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d So this White House announcement is great news. There are some very innovative companies working hard to update the grid, and hopefully states and utilities will tap into their knowledge. It\xe2\x80\x99s exciting.

In this installment of The Math Behind the Magic, we will be taking a look at how a computer works, down to the basic boolean algebra. To begin with, we need to take a look at how boolean algebra works, this will lead us into truth tables, and simple schematics. Building from these schematics we will look at Karnaugh maps, and higer level implementation. This higher level implementation will then be used to create an Arithmetic Logic Unit--the brains in a computer. We will end by desiging some simple memory schemes, the final stage in building a processor. By the end of this article, we will design a fully functional processor. Join in now! Since this article really covers several different levels, I've split them up according to topic. If you already understand a topic, feel free to skip around. If you are a novice to processor design, you'll probably get the most by starting at the first section, and following the leaders until the end. Start by getting a grasp on Boolean Algebra.

This week on \xe2\x80\x98Burials and Beyond\xe2\x80\x99, how to dispose of a body. As much as I\xe2\x80\x99d delight in upholding such a click-bait-y introduction, clarification is \xe2\x80\x93 sadly \xe2\x80\x93 imminent. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re inclined to murder and subsequent concealment, any deceased individual will pass through a chain of death professionals before they meet their final resting place. In this journey from death to internment and decay, we can be inclined to consider only hospital staff and funeral directors as sole \xe2\x80\x98handlers\xe2\x80\x99. However, they are integral pieces in the wider death jigsaw puzzle. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give a quick overview of a much-overlooked piece in the death and burial chain, that of the gravedigger. As a Brit, I live in a country of ever-increasing cremation. In 1960, cremation to burial rates were 34.70%, whereas in 2015, they had risen dramatically to 75.44%. \xc2\xa0Understandably, there are cultural and religious concerns to take into account in any burial practise, but overall, cremation is firmly the preferred method of \xe2\x80\x98burial\xe2\x80\x99 for citizens of the United Kingdom. For those of us who choose to have our deceased buried, whether for reasons of religion or tradition, our thoughts often only extend as far as the funeral director, and not beyond. Subsequently, many consider the journey of our dead less and less. We buy a package, perhaps view the body, attend the service and return home. However, should you choose to have your deceased buried, gravediggers are an integral piece of the journey we frequently overlook. To help with my post, Dan, a very patient former gravedigger, agreed to answer my barrage of questions. We know gravediggers exist, but our mental images of the profession are often warped by Victorian grotesques, or folk-take depictions of hunched sextons, busying themselves in remote churchyards. As delightfully gothic as these images may be, they are far from the contemporary truth. Should you live in a city, you can be sure there is a team of full-time, fully trained gravediggers waiting to bury your dead. Digging a grave is far more complex than \xe2\x80\x98dig a hole, chuck Nanna in, fill it up, pub, golden.\xe2\x80\x99 Funeral Directors are frequently seen as the main \xe2\x80\x98body burier\xe2\x80\x99, but in reality, they are far more of a middle-man, providing guidance and comfort. So, how does a gravedigger go about burying your corpse? Firstly, there will be an allocated plot within the cemetery \xe2\x80\x93 this may be a pre-purchased plot in prime position (with a prime price tag), or a regular plot assigned by the cemetery. Once the gravedigger has seen the plot, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to estimate the time needed to dig the hole. Typically, there is nothing simple or constant about digging a hole. The gravedigger will know the ground; soft clay will take less time than very rocky earth etc. Believe it or not, some graves may take half a day to dig by hand, whereas another plot 200 metres away may take three day\xe2\x80\x99s solid work with a mechanical digger and hydraulic hammer. So, with the plot known, you\xe2\x80\xa6still can\xe2\x80\x99t begin digging. Before shovel meets earth, the gravedigger needs to know the exact size and shape of the coffin (coffins taking precedence over caskets in the UK) as such a wide variety of styles require a wide variety of holes. If the details passed on from the funeral director are incorrect or dramatically change, the gravedigger has no choice but to quickly take a shovel to the graveside and re-size the hole in front of the grieving funeral party themselves. As a very tolerant gravedigger recounted \xe2\x80\x98a beetroot complexion and trying not to fall into a grave while trying to jam in a coffin is not a good look.\xe2\x80\x99 Having painfully foregone all temptations to make poor jokes as to the importance of size, now we must consider the equal importance of depth. If a grave is for one person, the gravedigger will typically dig to a depth of 4 ft. Most commonly, graves are dug for two internments, which will be around 6 to 6.5 ft deep. As my patient gravedigger recalls \xe2\x80\x98there is nothing more annoying than digging out a rock hard grave for two people, only to be told on the day it was only for one.\xe2\x80\x99 Similarly, multiple internments or family plots have their perils \xe2\x80\x98If you get a grave for four people, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get your miners hat on and take the caged canary with you! Being twelve foot down in a narrow grave is really very scary, and a ladder is a must!\xe2\x80\x99 In terms of practicality, before the coffin enters the ground the amount of earth leaving and returning to the hole must be considered \xe2\x80\x93 if none was removed from the pile of earth, there will be a large mound left once the grave is filled in. If too much is taken, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a trough-shaped problem on your hands. While digging, all graves are supported by wooden boards to try to prevent the earth falling in on the gravedigger themselves, but sometimes a collapse is imminent (see picture). Normally, such a collapse is little more than an irritant as the gravedigger may be free from harm, but the entire collapse must be re-structured and made safe before digging can continue. Another perpetual pain is that of water intrusion. If a grave reaches a natural spring and fills with water, or if there is a particularly heavy downpour, the grave can fill with water\xe2\x80\xa6 fast. So, how to solve such a problem with the funeral party gnashing at your heels. Gravedigger Dan says \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6you keep a pump running right up until the hearse pulls up, chuck a bag of dry leaves or straw down in the grave and whisper in the director\xe2\x80\x99s ear \xe2\x80\x9churry the fuck up!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99. He continues, \xe2\x80\x98I have been standing there and watched a coffin seem to be rising from the grave. Again, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but turn beetroot-faced when people are looking at you in horror\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 Similarly, gravediggers are no strangers to workplace mishaps. The webs (the straps used to lower a coffin) may snap, should they be in poor condition (a rare, but embarrassing hazard), and the coffin may tumble into the hole before the funeral party. Should the webs snap from a great height, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance the lid will pop off too, unveiling Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s wizened face to the world. Further to this, it is a rare, but not unseen site to see one of the funeral party fall in to the grave and break a bone or two of their own. Depending on cultural and personal demonstrations of grief, wilful flinging of oneself into the grave is slightly more common than such an unintended tumble. Through talking to Dan, he particularly emphasised that the greatest hindrance in the smooth burial of the deceased was the carelessness of other visitors to the cemetery. He has seen impatient people beeping their car horns at hearses as they both slowly enter the cemetery gates and others loudly cleaning and tending graves beside an ongoing service. He has seen cars driven into headstones and has had a careers-worth of abuse thrown his way from grieving families. So, the coffin is in, the funeral party has gone, time to bury the dead. This is done by hand and is usually straight forwards\xe2\x80\xa6 providing no rubble is being used, which may smash through the coffin when thrown in. Then back-filling picks up at double-speed to hide the exposed deceased! Once the grave is filled in, with a little mound on top to accommodate the earth sinking (when everything settles, this should give the grave a level ground), the gravediggers then arrange the flowers that had been put to one side, remove any sign of their presence and leave at last. Finally, cultural differences. Most cemeteries will be aware of different burial and funeral traditions and will subsequently accommodate or have measures in place for such rituals. Some cultures like to back-fill the grave themselves (which is a nice little break for the gravediggers!), others enjoy a graveside picnic and others may require water beside the grave so they can wash their own feet and the deceased themselves. Gravediggers may be a rather \xe2\x80\x98unseen\xe2\x80\x99 profession, but their importance cannot be over-stated. It also cannot be over-stated how much crap they must withstand from us, the grieving public, So, next time you\xe2\x80\x99re in need of their services, why not tip them? Or simply say a few words of thanks. Chances are, we\xe2\x80\x99ll all need their services eventually!

Make sure you check for the correct commit hash here.Run the command stack build to make sure your project builds.Add an import Okapi statement to your modules:module MyModule where import Okapi ... CabalComing soonNixComing soonBasic usageA server takes a request and returns the appropriate response. In Okapi, the correct response for any given request is decided by extracting data from or verifying properties of the request using parsers.TypesThe core type of the Okapi library is OkapiT m a.newtype OkapiT m a = OkapiT {unOkapiT :: Except.ExceptT Failure (State.StateT State m) a} deriving newtype ( Except.MonadError Failure, State.MonadState State ) Okapi also exports the type constraint MonadOkapi m, which is the abstract interface of OkapiT m.type MonadOkapi m = ( Functor m, Applicative m, Applicative.Alternative m, Monad m, Monad.MonadPlus m, Except.MonadError Failure m, State.MonadState State m ) We recommend using the type constraint instead of the concrete type to annotate your parsers.myParser :: OkapiT (ReaderT AppConfig IO) (Int, Char) myParser = ... -- Concrete not good. Lot\'s of boilerplate code for unwrapping and wrapping values. myParser\' :: (MonadOkapi m, MonadIO m, MonadReader AppConfig m) => m (Int, Char) myParser\' = do ... -- Abstract good. Less boilerplate. Can reuse and test easily. Your top level parser definition will probably need a concrete type annotation for your program to compile. To start, we recommend just using IO.module Main where import Okapi type Server = OkapiT IO -- Can parse HTTP requests + perform I/O main :: IO () main = run id -- ^ This argument is a function for changing an effectful computation `m a` into `IO a`. -- In this case it\'s just `id` since `id :: IO a -> IO a` myServer myServer :: Server Response myServer = myParser1 <|> myParser2 myParser1 :: (MonadOkapi m, MonadIO m) => m Response myParser1 = do logIO ""Using handler 1"" ... myParser2 :: MonadOkapi m => m Response myParser2 = ... logIO :: MonadIO m => String -> m () logIO msg = ... See Custom monad stack for more information on how to integrate your custom monad stack with this library.ParsersOkapi provides parsers to extract data from or verify properties of HTTP requests. They all have a return type of MonadOkapi m => m a, where a is some value.Parsers can either succeed or fail.For example, the methodGET parser succeeds if the HTTP request has the GET method, otherwise it fails.Parsers in Okapi are analagous to what most other web frameworks would call routes, but parsers are more granular and modular.There is a category of parsers for each component of an HTTP request:Method parsersThese parsers are for parsing the request method and are prefixed with method-.Examples: method, methodGET, methodPOST, methodPATCH, methodOPTIONSPath parsersThese parsers are for parsing the request path (excluding the query string) and are prefixed with path-.Examples: path, pathParamQuery parsersThese parsers are for parsing the request query and are prefixed with query-.Examples: query, queryParam, queryFlagBody parsersThese parsers are for parsing the request body and are prefixed with body-.Examples: body, bodyJSON, bodyURLEncodedHeader parsersThese parsers are for parsing the request headers and are prefixed with header- or cookie-.Examples: headers, header, cookie, cookieCrumbTo learn more about each parser, I recommend reading the haddock documentation for each parser and looking at the examples.Combining ParsersThere are two ways to combine parsers and create more complex ones:SequencingYou can execute one parser after another parser using do notation:getUser = do methodGET -- Check that the request method is GET pathParam `is` ""users"" -- Check that the first path parameter is ""users"" uid <- pathParam @UserID -- Bind second path parameter to `uid` as a `UserID` return $ setJSON uid $ ok -- Respond with 200 OK and the user\'s ID You can also use >> and >>=:getUser = methodGET >> pathParam `is` ""user"" >> pathParam @UserID >>= \\uid -> return $ setJSON uid $ ok A parser composed of a sequence of other parsers ONLY succeeds if all of the parsers in the sequence succeed. If any one of the parsers in the sequence fails, the entire parser fails.For example, the getUser parser defined above would fail if the HTTP request was POST /users/5, because the methodGET parser would fail. If the HTTP request was GET /guests/9, getUser would fail because the pathParam `is` ""users"" parser would fail.In summary, given parsers p1 and p2, the parser p3 defined as:p3 = do p1 p2 succeeds if p1 AND p2 succeed. p1 and p2 MAY be different types.BranchingYou can create a parser that tries multiple parsers using the <|> operator from Control.Applicative.Alternative:pingpong = ping <|> pong ping = do methodGET pathParam `is` ""ping"" return $ setJSON ""pong"" $ ok pong = do methodGET pathParam `is` ""pong"" return $ setJSON ""ping"" $ ok A parser composed of a set of parsers using the <|> operator succeeds if ANY of the parsers succeed.If all of the parsers in the composition fail, the entire parser fails.Using the pingpong parser as an example, if the incoming HTTP request was GET /ping, pingpong would succeed because the ping parser in ping <|> pong succeeds. If the incoming request was GET /pong, pingpong would still succeed. Eventhough ping in ping <|> pong would fail, pong would succeed, so pingpong = ping <|> pong succeeds.In summary, given parsers p1 and p2, the parser p3 defined as:p3 = p1 <|> p2 succeeds if p1 OR p2 succeed. p1 and p2 MUST be the same type.FailureThere are two functions that you can use to throw an error and terminate the parser: next and throw. The difference between the two mainly has to do with how they affect the behavior of the <|> operator.In short, given parsers p1 and p2, and a parser p3 defined as p3 = p1 <|> p2:If p1 fails with next, p2 is tried next.If p1 fails with throw, p2 isn\'t tried. Instead a response is returned immediately.As an example, let\'s say we have a simple calculator API defined like so:getXY :: Okapi (Int, Int) -- (1) getXY = do x <- pathParam y <- pathParam pure (x, y) divide :: Okapi Response -- (2) divide = do pathParam `is` ""div"" (x, y) <- getXY if y == 0 then next else return $ setJSON (x / y) $ ok multiply :: Okapi Response -- (3) multiply = do pathParam `is` ""mul"" (x, y) <- getXY return $ setJSON (x * y) $ ok calculator :: Okapi Response -- (4) calculator = do methodGET divide <|> multiply If the path parameter assigned to y is equal to 0, then the divide parser will fail and the multiply parser is tried next because next is used.If the divide parser was defined like this,divide :: Okapi Response divide = do pathParam `is` ""div"" (x, y) <- getXY if y == 0 then throw $ setJSON ""Dividing by 0 is forbidden"" $ forbidden else return $ setJSON (x / y) $ ok calculator :: Okapi Response calculator = do methodGET divide <|> multiply the calculator parser would immediately return a forbidden error response if the path parameter assigned to y was equal 0. The multiply parser isn\'t tried.Notice how throw takes a Response value as an argument. This is the response that is immediately returned by the parser when throw is called. No other parsers are tried.If you want to try the next parser, even if throw is used in the first branch, you can use the <!> operator.divide :: Okapi Response divide = do pathParam `is` ""div"" (x, y) <- getXY if y == 0 then throw $ setJSON ""Dividing by 0 is forbidden"" $ forbidden else return $ setJSON (x / y) $ ok calculator :: Okapi Response calculator = do methodGET divide <!> multiply If we feed the request GET /div/5/0 to this definition of calculator, both div and multiply would be tried. calculator is defined using <!> instead of <|>, so even though divide calls throw when y == 0, the next parser multiply is tried anyway!See Error handling for more information on errors and how to handle them.CombinatorsCombinators are functions that modify parsers. They are higher order parsers, meaning they take a parser as an argument and give you back a parser. Most of these combinators can be found in the parser-combinators library. To use it, just add parser-combinators to your dependencies and import Control.Monad.Combinators into your modules. There are several, but the most used ones are is, optional, and option so let\'s cover those.is is for comparing some data in the request to a value. It\'s mostly used for matching on the request path-- | Works for GET /books/fiction/sci-fi bookstore = do methodGET pathParam `is`  ooks"" pathParam `is` ""fiction"" pathParam `is` ""sci-fi"" sciFiBooks <- execDBQuery ... return $ setJSON sciFiBooks $ ok , but can be used with any parser.-- | Works for GET /books/fiction?subgenre=sci-fi bookstore = do methodGET pathParam `is`  ooks"" pathParam `is` ""fiction"" queryParam ""subgenre"" `is` ""sci-fi"" sciFiBooks <- execDBQuery ... return $ setJSON sciFiBooks $ ok Another important combinator is optional. optional allows you to handle a parser that fails, in your own way by turning the result of type a in to a result of type Maybe a. If the parser fails, it returns a Nothing. If it succeeds, it returns Just x where x :: a. Let\'s look at the example used in the hero of this page, the greet server:-- | Works for /greet/<name> OR /greet?name=<name> OR /greet greet = do methodGET pathParam @Text `is` ""greet"" maybeName <- optional (pathParam <|> queryParam ""name"") pathEnd let greeting = case maybeName of Nothing -> ""Hello there."" Just name -> ""Hello, "" <> name <> ""."" return $ setPlainText greeting $ ok Thanks to optional, if pathParam <|> queryParam ""name"" fails, we can provide a default value. In this case, we assign greeting to ""Hello there."" because we have no name.Another way to catch failures and use a default value is by using option. Using option, we can modify the greet server defined above like this:-- | Works for /greet/<name> OR /greet?name=<name> OR /greet greet = do methodGET pathParam @Text `is` ""greet"" name <- option ""Stranger"" (pathParam <|> queryParam ""name"") pathEnd let greeting = ""Hello, "" <> name <> ""."" return $ setPlainText greeting $ ok option takes a default value as its first argument, and a parser. If the parser passed into option succeeds, a value is returned as usual. If the parser fails then no value can be returned by the parser, so the default value passed into option is used instead. For example, if we sent the request GET /greet to the greet server defined using option, we\'d get ""Hello, Stranger."" because we don\'t give it a name parameter and it uses the default ""Stranger"".See Parser combinators for more information on combinators and how to use them.Getting helpClick on the GitHub icon in the upper right corner to go to the repository and submit an issue.

Instead, it mindlessly spat out biased and incorrect nonsense. By Will Douglas Heavenarchive pageNovember 18, 2022Stephanie Arnett/MITTR; Getty, Envato, NASA On November 15 Meta unveiled a new large language model called Galactica, designed to assist scientists. But instead of landing with the big bang Meta hoped for, Galactica has died with a whimper after three days of intense criticism. Yesterday the company took down the public demo that it had encouraged everyone to try out. Meta\xe2\x80\x99s misstep\xe2\x80\x94and its hubris\xe2\x80\x94show once again that Big Tech has a blind spot about the severe limitations of large language models. There is a large body of research that highlights the flaws of this technology, including its tendencies to reproduce prejudice and assert falsehoods as facts.\xc2\xa0 Related StoryChatbots could one day replace search engines. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible idea.Language models are mindless mimics that do not understand what they are saying\xe2\x80\x94so why do we pretend they\xe2\x80\x99re experts? However, Meta and other companies working on large language models, including Google, have failed to take it seriously. Galactica is a large language model for science, trained on 48 million examples of scientific articles, websites, textbooks, lecture notes, and encyclopedias. Meta promoted its model as a shortcut for researchers and students. In the company\xe2\x80\x99s words, Galactica \xe2\x80\x9ccan summarize academic papers, solve math problems, generate Wiki articles, write scientific code, annotate molecules and proteins, and more.\xe2\x80\x9d But the shiny veneer wore through fast. Like all language models, Galactica is a mindless bot that cannot tell fact from fiction. Within hours, scientists were sharing its biased and incorrect results on social media. Absolutely.Galactica is little more than statistical nonsense at scale.Amusing. Dangerous. And IMHO unethical. https://t.co/15DAFJCzIb\xe2\x80\x94 Grady Booch (@Grady_Booch) November 17, 2022 \xe2\x80\x9cI am both astounded and unsurprised by this new effort,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chirag Shah at the University of Washington, who studies search technologies. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it comes to demoing these things, they look so fantastic, magical, and intelligent. But people still don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to grasp that in principle such things can\xe2\x80\x99t work the way we hype them up to.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked for a statement on why it had removed the demo, Meta pointed MIT Technology Review to a tweet that says: \xe2\x80\x9cThank you everyone for trying the Galactica model demo. We appreciate the feedback we have received so far from the community, and have paused the demo for now. Our models are available for researchers who want to learn more about the work and reproduce results in the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d A fundamental problem with Galactica is that it is not able to distinguish truth from falsehood, a basic requirement for a language model designed to generate scientific text. People found that it made up fake papers (sometimes attributing them to real authors), and generated wiki articles about the history of bears in space as readily as ones about protein complexes and the speed of light. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to spot fiction when it involves space bears, but harder with a subject users may not know much about. Many scientists pushed back hard. Michael Black, director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany, who works on deep learning, tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cIn all cases, it was wrong or biased but sounded right and authoritative. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked #Galactica about some things I know about and I'm troubled. In all cases, it was wrong or biased but sounded right and authoritative. I think it's dangerous. Here are a few of my experiments and my analysis of my concerns. (1/9)\xe2\x80\x94 Michael Black (@Michael_J_Black) November 17, 2022 Even more positive opinions came with clear caveats: \xe2\x80\x9cExcited to see where this is headed!\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted Miles Cranmer, an astrophysicist at Princeton. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should never keep the output verbatim or trust it. Basically, treat it like an advanced Google search of (sketchy) secondary sources!\xe2\x80\x9d Galactica also has problematic gaps in what it can handle. When asked to generate text on certain topics, such as \xe2\x80\x9cracism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAIDS,\xe2\x80\x9d the model responded with: \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, your query didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass our content filters. Try again and keep in mind this is a scientific language model.\xe2\x80\x9d Related StoryInside a radical new project to democratize AIA group of over 1,000 AI researchers has created a multilingual large language model bigger than GPT-3\xe2\x80\x94and they\xe2\x80\x99re giving it out for free. The Meta team behind Galactica argues that language models are better than search engines. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe this will be the next interface for how humans access scientific knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d the researchers write. This is because language models can \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially store, combine, and reason about\xe2\x80\x9d information. But that \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially\xe2\x80\x9d is crucial. It\xe2\x80\x99s a coded admission that language models cannot yet do all these things. And they may never be able to. \xe2\x80\x9cLanguage models are not really knowledgeable beyond their ability to capture patterns of strings of words and spit them out in a probabilistic manner,\xe2\x80\x9d says Shah. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives a false sense of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist at New York University and a vocal critic of deep learning, gave his view in a Substack post titled \xe2\x80\x9cA Few Words About Bullshit,\xe2\x80\x9d saying that the ability of large language models to mimic human-written text is nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9ca superlative feat of statistics.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet Meta is not the only company championing the idea that language models could replace search engines. For the last couple of years, Google has been promoting its language model PaLM as a way to look up information. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tantalizing idea. But suggesting that the human-like text such models generate will always contain trustworthy information, as Meta appeared to do in its promotion of Galactica, is reckless and irresponsible. It was an unforced error. My considered opinion of Galactica: it's fun, impressive, and interesting in many ways. Great achievement. It's just unfortunate that it's being touted as a practical research tool, and even more unfortunate that it suggests you use it to write complete articles.\xe2\x80\x94 Julian Togelius (@togelius) November 17, 2022 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the fault of Meta\xe2\x80\x99s marketing team. Yann LeCun, a Turing Award winner and Meta\xe2\x80\x99s chief scientist, defended Galactica to the end. On the day the model was released, LeCun tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cType a text and Galactica will generate a paper with relevant references, formulas, and everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Three days later, he tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cGalactica demo is off line for now.

78,Inside boost::unordered_flat_map (bannalia.blogspot.com),http://bannalia.blogspot.com/2022/11/inside-boostunorderedflatmap.html,71,"b'Bannalia: trivial notes on themes diverse: Inside boost::unordered_flat_map Bannalia: trivial notes on themes diverse Friday, November 18, 2022 Inside boost::unordered_flat_map IntroductionThe case for open addressing SIMD-accelerated lookup boost::unordered_flat_map data structureRehashingHash post-mixingStatistical properties of boost::unordered_flat_mapBenchmarks Running-n plotsAggregate performance Deviations from the standardConclusions and next steps Introduction Starting in Boost 1.81 (December 2022), Boost.Unordered provides, in addition to its previous implementations of C++ unordered associative containers, the new containers boost::unordered_flat_map and boost::unordered_flat_set (for the sake of brevity, we will only refer to the former in the remaining of this article). If boost::unordered_map strictly adheres to the C++ specification for std::unordered_map, boost::unordered_flat_map deviates in a number of ways from the standard to offer dramatic performance improvements in exchange; in fact, boost::unordered_flat_map ranks amongst the fastest hash containers currently available to C++ users. We describe the internal structure of boost::unordered_flat_map and provide theoretical analyses and benchmarking data to help readers gain insights into the key design elements behind this container\'s excellent performance. Interface and behavioral differences with the standard are also discussed. The case for open addressing We have previously discussed why closed addressing was chosen back in 2003 as the implicit layout for std::unordered_map. 20 years after, open addressing techniques have taken the lead in terms of performance, and the fastest hash containers in the market all rely on some variation of open addressing, even if that means that some deviations have to be introduced from the baseline interface of std::unordered_map. The defining aspect of open addressing is that elements are stored directly within the bucket array (as opposed to closed addressing, where multiple elements can be held into the same bucket, usually by means of a linked list of nodes). In modern CPU architectures, this layout is extremely cache friendly: There\'s no indirection needed to go from the bucket position to the element contained.Buckets are stored contiguously in memory, which improves cache locality. The main technical challenge introduced by open addressing is what to do when elements are mapped into the same bucket, i.e. when a collision happens: in fact, all open-addressing variations are basically characterized by their collision management techniques. We can divide these techniques into two broad classes: Non-relocating: if an element is mapped to an occupied bucket, a probing sequence is started from that position until a vacant bucket is located, and the element is inserted there permanently (except, of course, if the element is deleted or if the bucket array is grown and elements rehashed). Popular probing mechanisms are linear probing (buckets inspected at regular intervals), quadratic probing and double hashing. There is a tradeoff between cache locality, which is better when the buckets probed are close to each other, and average probe length (the expected number of buckets probed until a vacant one is located), which grows larger (worse) precisely when probed buckets are close \xe2\x80\x94elements tend to form clusters instead of spreading uniformly throughout the bucket array.Relocating: as part of the search process for a vacant bucket, elements can be moved from their position to make room for the new element. This is done in order to improve cache locality by keeping elements close to their ""natural"" location (that indicated by the hash \xe2\x86\x92 bucket mapping). Well known relocating algorithms are cuckoo hashing, hopscotch hashing and Robin Hood hashing. If we take it as an important consideration to stay reasonably close to the original behavior of std::unordered_map, relocating techniques pose the problem that insert may invalidate iterators to other elements (so, they work more like std::vector::insert). On the other hand, non-relocating open addressing faces issues on deletion: lookup starts at the original hash \xe2\x86\x92 bucket position and then keeps probing till the element is found or probing terminates, which is signalled by the presence of a vacant bucket: So, erasing an element can\'t just restore its holding bucket as vacant, since that would preclude lookup from reaching elements further down the probe sequence: A common techique to deal with this problem is to label buckets previously containing an element with a tombstone marker: tombstones are good for inserting new elements but do not stop probing on lookup: Note that the introduction of tombstones implies that the average lookup probe length of the container won\'t decrease on deletion \xe2\x80\x94again, special measures can be taken to counter this. SIMD-accelerated lookup SIMD technologies, such as SSE2 and Neon, provide advanced CPU instructions for parallel arithmetic and logical operations on groups of contiguous data values: for instance, SSE2 _mm_cmpeq_epi8 takes two packs of 16 bytes and compares them for equality pointwise, returning the result as another pack of bytes. Although SIMD was originally meant for acceleration of multimedia processing applications, the implementors of some unordered containers, notably Google\'s Abseil\'s Swiss tables and Meta\'s F14, realized they could leverage this technology to improve lookup times in hash tables. The key idea is to maintain, in addition to the bucket array itself, a separate metadata array holding reduced hash values (usually one byte in size) obtained from the hash values of the elements stored in the corresponding buckets. When looking up for an element, SIMD can be used on a pack of contiguous reduced hash values to quickly discard non-matching buckets and move on to full comparison for matching positions. This technique effectively checks a moderate number of buckets (16 for Abseil, 14 for F14) in constant time. Another beneficial effect of this approach is that special bucket markers (vacant, tombstone, etc.) can be moved to the metadata array \xe2\x80\x94otherwise, these markers would take up extra space in the bucket itself, or else some representation values of the elements would have to be restricted from user code and reserved for marking purposes. boost::unordered_flat_map data structure boost::unordered_flat_map\'s bucket array is logically split into 2n groups of N = 15 buckets, and has a companion metadata array consisting of 2n 16-byte words. Hash mapping is done at the group level rather than on individual buckets: so, to insert an element with hash value h, the group at position h / 2W \xe2\x88\x92 n is selected and its first available bucket used (W is 64 or 32 depending on whether the CPU architecture is 64- or 32-bit, respectively); if the group is full, further groups are checked using a quadratic probing sequence. The associated metadata is organized as follows (least significant byte depicted rightmost): hi holds information about the i-th bucket of the group: 0 if the bucket is empty,1 to signal a sentinel (a special value at the end of the bucket array used to finish container iteration).otherwise, a reduced hash value in the range [2, 255] obtained from the least significant byte of the element\'s hash value. When looking up within a group for an element with hash value h, SIMD operations, if available, are used to match the reduced value of h against the pack of values {h0, h1, ... , h14}. Locating an empty bucket for insertion is equivalent to matching for 0. ofw is the so-called overflow byte: when inserting an element with hash value h, if the group is full then the (h mod 8)-th bit of ofw is set to 1 before moving to the next group in the probing sequence. Lookup probing can then terminate when the corresponding overflow bit is 0. Note that this procedure removes the need to use tombstones. If neither SSE2 nor Neon is available on the target architecture, the logical organization of metadata stays the same, but information is mapped to two physical 64-bit words using bit interleaving as shown in the figure: Bit interleaving allows for a reasonably fast implementation of matching operations in the absence of SIMD. Rehashing The maximum load factor of boost::unordered_flat_map is 0.875 and can\'t be changed by the user. As discussed previously, non-relocating open addressing has the problem that average probe length doesn\'t decrease on deletion when the erased elements are in mid-sequence: so, continously inserting and erasing elements without triggering a rehash will slowly degrade the container\'s performance; we call this phenomenon drifting. boost::unordered_flat_map introduces the following anti-drift mechanism: rehashing is controled by the container\'s maximum load, initially 0.875 times the size of the bucket array; when erasing an element whose associated overflow bit is not zero, the maximum load is decreased by one. Anti-drift guarantees that rehashing will be eventually triggered in a scenario of repeated insertions and deletions. Hash post-mixing It is well known that open-addressing containers require that the hash function be of good quality, in the sense that close input values (for some natural notion of closeness) are mapped to distant hash values. In particular, a hash function is said to have the avalanching property if flipping a bit in the physical representation of the input changes all bits of the output value with probability 50%. Note that avalanching hash functions are extremely well behaved, and less stringent behaviors are generally good enough in most open-addressing scenarios. Being a general-purpose container, boost::unordered_flat_map does not impose any condition on the user-provided hash function beyond what is required by the C++ standard for unordered associative containers. In order to cope with poor-quality hash functions (such as the identity for integral types), an automatic bit-mixing stage is added to hash values: 64-bit architectures: we use the xmx function defined in Jon Maiga\'s ""The construct of a bit mixer"".32-bit architectures: the chosen mixer has been automatically generated by Hash Function Prospector and selected as the best overall performer in internal benchmarks. Score assigned by Hash Prospector: 333.7934929677524. There\'s an opt-out mechanism available to end users so that avalanching hash functions can be marked as such and thus be used without post-mixing. In particular, the specializations of boost::hash for string types are marked as avalanching. Statistical properties of boost::unordered_flat_map We have written a simulation program to calculate some statistical properties of boost::unordered_flat_map as compared with Abseil\'s absl::flat_hash_map, which is generally regarded as one of the fastest hash containers available. For the purposes of this analysis, the main design characteristics of absl::flat_hash_map are: Bucket array sizes are of the form 2n, n \xe2\x89\xa5 4.Hash mapping is done at the bucket level (rather than at the group level as in boost::unordered_flat_map).Metadata consists of one byte per bucket, where the most significant bit is set to 1 if the bucket is empty, deleted (tombstone) or a sentinel. The remaining 7 bits hold the reduced hash value for occupied buckets.Lookup/insertion uses SIMD to inspect the 16 contiguous buckets beginning at the hash-mapped position, and then continues with further 16-bucket groups using quadratic probing. Probing ends when a non-full group is found. Note that the start positions of these groups are not aligned modulo 16. The figure shows: the probability that a randomly selected group is full,the average number of hops (i.e. the average probe length minus one) for successful and unsuccessful lookup as functions of the load factor, with perfectly random input and without intervening deletions. Solid line is boost::unordered_flat_map, dashed line is absl::flat_hash_map. Some observations: Pr(group is full) is higher for boost::unordered_flat_map. This follows from the fact that free buckets cluster at the end of 15-aligned groups, whereas for absl::flat_hash_map free buckets are uniformly distributed across the array, which increases the probability that a contiguous 16-bucket chunk contains at least one free position. Consequently, E(num hops) for successful lookup is also higher in boost::unordered_flat_map.By contrast, E(num hops) for unsuccessful lookup is considerably lower in boost::unordered_flat_map: absl::flat_hash_map uses an all-or-nothing condition for probe termination (group is non-full/full), whereas boost::unordered_flat_map uses the 8 bits of information in the overflow byte to allow for more finely-grained termination \xe2\x80\x94effectively, making probe termination ~1.75 times more likely. The overflow byte acts as a sort of Bloom filter to check for probe termination based on reduced hash value. The next figure shows the average number of actual comparisons (i.e. when the reduced hash value matched) for successful and unsuccessful lookup. Again, solid line is boost::unordered_flat_map and dashed line is absl::flat_hash_map. E(num cmps) is a function of: E(num hops) (lower better),the size of the group (lower better),the number of bits of the reduced hash value (higher better). We see then that boost::unordered_flat_map approaches absl::flat_hash_map on E(num cmps) for successful lookup (1% higher or less), despite its poorer E(num hops) figures: this is so because boost::unordered_flat_map uses smaller groups (15 vs. 16) and, most importantly, because its reduced hash values contain log2(254) = 7.99 bits vs. 7 bits in absl::flat_hash_map, and each additional bit in the hash reduced value decreases the number of negative comparisons roughly by half. In the case of E(num cmps) for unsuccessful lookup, boost::unordered_flat_map figures are up to 3.2 times lower under high-load conditions. Benchmarks Running-n plots We have measured the execution times of boost::unordered_flat_map against absl::flat_hash_map and boost::unordered_map for basic operations (insertion, erasure during iteration, successful lookup, unsuccessful lookup) with container size n ranging from 10,000 to 10M. We provide the full benchmark code and results for different 64- and 32-bit architectures in a dedicated repository; here, we just show the plots for GCC 11 in x64 mode on an AMD EPYC Rome 7302P @ 3.0GHz. Please note that each container uses its own default hash function, so a direct comparison of execution times may be slightly biased. Running insertion Running erasure Successful lookup Unsuccessful lookup As predicted by our statistical analysis, boost::unordered_flat_map is considerably faster than absl::flat_hash_map for unsuccessful lookup because the average probe length and number of (negative) comparisons are much lower; this effect translates also to insertion, since insert needs to first check that the element is not present, so it internally performs an unsuccessful lookup. Note how performance is less impacted (stays flatter) when the load factor increases. As for successful lookup, boost::unordered_flat_map is still faster, which may be due to its better cache locality, particularly for low load factors: in this situation, elements are clustered at the beginning portion of each group, while for absl::flat_hash_map they are uniformly distributed with more empty space in between. boost::unordered_flat_map is slower than absl::flat_hash_map for runnning erasure (erasure of some elements during container traversal). The actual culprit here is iteration, which is particularly slow; this is a collateral effect of having SIMD operations work only on 16-aligned metadata words, while absl::flat_hash_map iteration looks ahead 16 metadata bytes beyond the current iterator position. Aggregate performance Boost.Unordered provides a series of benchmarks emulating real-life scenarios combining several operations for a number of hash containers and key types (std::string, std::string_view, std::uint32_t, std::uint64_t and a UUID class of size 16).

Deviations from the standard The adoption of open addressing imposes a number of deviations from the C++ standard for unordered associative containers. Users should keep them in mind when migrating to boost::unordered_flat_map from boost::unordered_map (or from any other implementation of std::unordered_map): Both Key and T in boost::unordered_flat_map<Key,T> must be MoveConstructible. This is due to the fact that elements are stored directly into the bucket array and have to be transferred to a new block of memory on rehashing; by contrast, boost::unordered_map is a node-based container and elements are never moved once constructed.For the same reason, pointers and references to elements become invalid after rehashing (boost::unordered_map only invalidates iterators).begin() is not constant-time (the bucket array is traversed till the first non-empty bucket is found).erase(iterator) returns void rather than an iterator to the element after the erased one. This is done to maximize performance, as locating the next element requires traversing the bucket array; if that element is absolutely required, the erase(iterator++) idiom can be used. This performance issue is not exclusive to open addressing, and has been discussed in the context of the C++ standard too.The maximum load factor can\'t be changed by the user (max_load_factor(z) is provided for backwards compatibility reasons, but does nothing). Rehashing can occur before the load reaches max_load_factor() * bucket_count() due to the anti-drift mechanism described previously.There is no bucket API (bucket_size, begin(n), etc.) save bucket_count.There are no node handling facilities ( extract, etc.) Such functionality makes no sense here as open-addressing containers are precisely not node-based. merge is provided, but the implementation relies on element movement rather than node transferring. Conclusions and next steps boost::unordered_flat_map and boost::unordered_flat_set are the new open-addressing containers in Boost.Unordered providing top speed in exchange for some interface and behavioral deviations from the standards-compliant boost::unordered_map and boost::unordered_set. We have analyzed their internal data structure and provided some theoretical and practical evidence for their excellent performance. As of this writing, we claim boost::unordered_flat_map/boost::unordered_flat_set to rank among the fastest hash containers available to C++ programmers. With this work, we have reached an important milestone in the ongoing Development Plan for Boost.Unordered. After Boost 1.81, we will continue improving the functionality and performance of existing containers and will possibly augment the available container catalog to offer greater freedom of choice to Boost users. Your feedback on our current and future work is much welcome.

Those complexities include: Two major current packaging formats (source distributions and wheels), as well as a smattering of domain-specific and legacy formats (zipapps, Python Eggs, conda\xe2\x80\x99s own format, &c.); A constellation of different packaging tools and package specification files: setuptools, flit, poetry, and PDM, as well as pip, pipx, and pipenv for actually installing packages; \xe2\x80\xa6and a corresponding constellation of package and dependency specification files: pyproject.toml (PEP 518-style), pyproject.toml (Poetry-style), setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, requirements.txt, MANIFEST.in, and so forth. This post will cover just one tiny piece of Python packaging\xe2\x80\x99s complexity: the CPython stable ABI. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the stable ABI is, why it exists, how it\xe2\x80\x99s integrated into Python packaging, and how each piece goes terribly wrong to make accidental ABI violations easy. The CPython stable API and ABI Not unlike many other reference implementations, Python\xe2\x80\x99s reference implementation (CPython) is written in C and provides two mechanisms for native interaction: A C Application Programming Interface (API), allowing C and C++ programmers to compile against CPython\xe2\x80\x99s public headers and use any exposed functionality; An Application Binary Interface (ABI), allowing any language with C ABI support (like Rust or Golang) to link against CPython\xe2\x80\x99s runtime and use the same internals Developers can use the CPython API and ABI to write CPython extensions. These extensions behave exactly like ordinary Python modules but interact directly with the interpreter\xe2\x80\x99s implementation details rather than the \xe2\x80\x9chigh-level\xe2\x80\x9d objects and APIs exposed in Python itself. CPython extensions are a cornerstone of the Python ecosystem: they provide an \xe2\x80\x9cescape hatch\xe2\x80\x9d for performance-critical tasks in Python, as well as enable code reuse from native languages (like the broader C, C++, and Rust packaging ecosystems). At the same time, extensions pose a problem: CPython\xe2\x80\x99s APIs change between releases (as the implementation details of CPython change), meaning that it is unsound, by default, to load a CPython extension into an interpreter of a different version. The implications of this unsoundness vary: a user might get lucky and have no problems at all, might experience crashes due to missing functions or, worst of all, experience memory corruption due to changes in function signatures and structure layouts. To ameliorate the situation, CPython\xe2\x80\x99s developers created the stable API and ABI: a set of macros, types, functions, and data objects that are guaranteed to remain available and forward-compatible between minor releases. In other words: a CPython extension built for CPython 3.7\xe2\x80\x99s stable API will also load and function correctly on CPython 3.8 and forwards, but is not guaranteed to load and function with CPython 3.6 or earlier. At the ABI level, this compatibility is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cabi3\xe2\x80\x9d, and is optionally tagged in the extension\xe2\x80\x99s filename: mymod.abi3.so, for example, designates a loadable stable-ABI-compatible CPython extension module named mymod. Critically, the Python interpreter does not do anything with this tag \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s simply ignored. This is the first strike: CPython has no notion of whether an extension is actually stable-ABI-compatible. We\xe2\x80\x99ll now see how this compounds with the state of Python packaging to produce even more problems. CPython extensions and packaging On its own, a CPython extension is just a bare Python module. To be useful to others, it needs to be packaged and distributed like all other modules. With source distributions, packaging a CPython extension is straightforward (for some definitions of straightforward): the source distribution\xe2\x80\x99s build system (generally setup.py) describes the compilation steps needed to produce the native extension, and the package installer runs these steps during installation. For example, here\xe2\x80\x99s how we define microx\xe2\x80\x99s native extension (microx_core) using setuptools: Distributing a CPython extension via source distribution has advantages (\xe2\x9c\x85) and disadvantages (\xe2\x9d\x8c): \xe2\x9c\x85API and ABI stability are non-issues: the package either builds during installation or it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and, when it does build, it runs against the same interpreter that it built against. \xe2\x9c\x85Source builds are burdensome for users: they require end-users of Python software to install the CPython development headers, as well as maintain a native toolchain corresponding to the language or ecosystem that the extension targets. That means requiring a C/C++ (and increasingly, Rust) toolchain on every deployment machine, adding size and complexity. \xe2\x9d\x8cSource builds are fundamentally fragile: compilers and native dependencies are in constant flux, leaving end users (who are Python experts at best, not compiled language experts) to debug compiler and linker errors. The Python packaging ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99s solution to these problems is wheels. Wheels are a binary distribution format, which means that they can (but are not required to) provide pre-compiled binary extensions and other shared objects that can be installed as-is, without custom build steps. This is where ABI compatibility is absolutely essential: binary wheels are loaded blindly by the CPython interpreter, so any mismatch between the actual and expected interpreter ABIs can cause crashes (or worse, exploitable memory corruption). Because wheels can contain pre-compiled extensions, they need to be tagged for the version(s) of Python that they support. This tagging is done with PEP 425-style \xe2\x80\x9ccompatibility\xe2\x80\x9d tags: microx-1.4.1-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl designates a wheel that was built for CPython 3.7 on macOS 10.15 for x86-64, meaning that other Python versions, host OSes, and architectures should not attempt to install it. On its own, this limitation makes wheel packaging for CPython extensions a bit of a hassle: \xe2\x9d\x8cIn order to support all valid combinations of {Python Version, Host OS, Host Architecture}, the packager must build a valid wheel for each. This means additional test, build, and distribution complexity, as well as exponential CI growth as a package\xe2\x80\x99s support matrix expands. \xe2\x9d\x8cBecause wheels are (by default) tied to a single Python version, packagers are required to generate a new set of wheels on each Python minor version change. In other words: new Python versions start out without access to a significant chunk of the packaging ecosystem until packagers can play catch up. This is where the stable ABI becomes critical: instead of building one wheel per Python, version packagers can build an \xe2\x80\x9cabi3\xe2\x80\x9d wheel for the lowest supported Python version. This comes with the guarantee that the wheel will work on all future (minor) releases, solving both the build matrix size problem and the ecosystem bootstrapping problem above. Building an \xe2\x80\x9cabi3\xe2\x80\x9d wheel is a two-step process: the wheel is built locally (usually using the same build system as the source distribution) and then retagged with abi3 as the ABI tag rather than a single Python version (like cp37 for CPython 3.7). Critically: neither of these steps is validated, because Python\xe2\x80\x99s build tools have no good way to validate them. This leaves us with the second and third strikes: To correctly build a wheel against the stable API and ABI, the build needs to set the Py_LIMITED_API macro to the intended CPython support version (or, for Rust with PyO3, to use the correct build feature). This prevents Python\xe2\x80\x99s C headers from using non-stable functionality or potentially inlining incompatible implementation details. For example, to build a wheel as cp37-abi3 (stable ABI for CPython 3.7+), the extension needs to either #define Py_LIMITED_API 0x03070000 in its own source code, or use the setuptools.Extension construct\xe2\x80\x99s define_macros argument to configure it. These are easy to forget, and produce no warning when forgotten! Additionally, when using setuptools, the packager may choose to set py_limited_api=True. But this does not enable any actual API restrictions; it merely adds the .abi3 tag to the built extension\xe2\x80\x99s filename. As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall this is not currently checked by the CPython interpreter, so this is effectively a no-op. To tag a wheel for the stable ABI, users of the official wheel module and bdist_wheel subcommand are expected to use the --py-limited-api=cp37 flag, where 37 is the targeted minimum CPython version (3.7, here). This flag controls the wheel\xe2\x80\x99s filename components, as seen here: Critically, it does not affect the actual wheel build. The wheel is built however the underlying setuptools.Extension sees fit: it might be completely right, it might be a little wrong (stable ABI, but for the wrong CPython version), or it might be completely wrong. This breakdown happens because of the devolved nature of Python packaging: the code that builds extensions is in pypa/setuptools, while the code that builds wheels is in pypa/wheel \xe2\x80\x94 two completely separate codebases. Extension building is designed as a black box, a fact that Rust and other language ecosystems take advantage of (there is no Py_LIMITED_API macro to sensibly define in a PyO3-based extension \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s all handled separately by build features). To summarize: Stable ABI (\xe2\x80\x9cabi3\xe2\x80\x9d) wheels are the only reliable way to package native extensions without a massive build matrix. However, none of the dials that control abi3-compatible wheel building talk to each other: it\xe2\x80\x99s possibly to build an abi3-compatible wheel without tagging it as such, or to build a non-abi3 wheel and tag it incorrectly as compatible, or to tag an abi3-compatible wheel as compatible with the wrong CPython version. Consequently, the correctness of the current abi3-compatible wheel ecosystem is suspect. ABI violations are capable of causing crashes and even exploitable memory corruption, so we need to quantify the current state of affairs. How bad is it, really? This all seems pretty bad, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just an abstract problem: it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that every Python packager gets their wheel builds right, and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t published any incorrectly tagged (or completely invalid) abi3-style wheels. To get a sense for how bad things really are, we developed abi3audit. Abi3audit\xe2\x80\x99s entire raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre is finding these kinds of ABI violation bugs: it scans individual extensions, Python wheels (which can contain multiple extensions), and entire package histories, reporting back anything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match the specified stable ABI version or is entirely incompatible with the stable ABI. To get a list of auditable packages to feed into abi3audit, I used PyPI\xe2\x80\x99s public BigQuery dataset to generate a list of every abi3-wheel-containing package downloaded from PyPI in the last 21 days: #standardSQL SELECT DISTINCT file.project FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads` WHERE file.filename LIKE '%abi3%' -- Only query the last 21 days of history AND DATE(timestamp) BETWEEN DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 21 DAY) AND CURRENT_DATE() ( I chose 21 because I blew through my BigQuery quota while testing. It\xe2\x80\x99d be interesting to see the full list of downloads over a year or the entire history of PyPI, although I\xe2\x80\x99d expect diminishing returns.) From that query, I got 357 packages, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve uploaded as a GitHub Gist. With those packages saved, a JSON report from abi3audit was only a single invocation away: The JSON from that audit is also available as a GitHub Gist. First, some high-level statistics: Of the 357 initial packages queried from PyPI, 339 actually contained auditable wheels. Some were 404s (presumably created and then deleted), while others were tagged with abi3 but did not actually contain any CPython extension modules (which does, technically, make them abi3 compatible!). A handful of these were ctypes-style modules, with either a vendored library or code to load a library that the host was expected to contain. Those 339 remaining packages had a total of 13650 abi3-tagged wheels between them. The largest (in terms of wheels) was eclipse-zenoh-nightly, with 1596 wheels (or nearly 12 percent of all abi3-tagged wheels on PyPI). The 13650 abi3-tagged wheels had a total of 39544 shared objects, each a potential Python extension, between them. In other words: the average abi3-tagged wheel has 2.9 shared objects in it, each of which was audited by abi3audit. Attempting to parse each shared object in each abi3-tagged wheel produced all kinds of curious results: plenty of wheels contained invalid shared objects: ELF files that began with garbage (but contained a valid ELF later in the file), temporary build artifacts that weren\xe2\x80\x99t cleaned up, and a handful of wheels that appeared to contain editor-style swap files for hand-modified binaries. Unfortunately, unlike Moyix, we did not discover any catgirls. Now, the juicy parts: Of the 357 valid packages, 54 (15 percent) contained wheels with ABI version violations. In other words: roughly one in six packages had wheels that claimed support for a particular Python version, but actually used the ABI of a newer Python version. More severely: of those same 357 valid packages, 11 (3.1 percent) contained outright ABI violations. In other words: roughly one in thirty packages had wheels that claimed to be stable ABI compatible, but weren\xe2\x80\x99t at all! In total, 1139 (roughly 3 percent) Python extensions had version violations, and 90 (roughly 0.02 percent) had outright ABI violations. This suggests two things: that the same packages tend to have ABI violations across multiple wheels and extensions, and that multiple extensions within the same wheel tend to have ABI violations at the same time (which makes sense, since they should share the same build). Here are some that we found particularly interesting: PyQt6 and sip PyQt6 and sip are both part of the Qt project, and both had ABI version violations: multiple wheels were tagged for CPython 3.6 (cp36-abi3), but used APIs that were only stabilized with CPython 3.7. sip additionally had a handful of wheels with outright ABI violations, all from the internal _Py_DECREF API: refl1d refl1d is a NIST-developed reflectometry package. They did a couple of releases tagged for the stable ABI of Python 3.2 (the absolute lowest), while actually targeting the stable ABI of Python 3.11 (the absolute highest \xe2\x80\x94 not even released yet!). hdbcli hdbcli appears to be a proprietary client for SAP HANA, published by SAP themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s tagged as abi3, which is cool! Unfortunately, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually abi3-compatible: This, again, suggests building without the correct macros. We\xe2\x80\x99d be able to figure out more with the source code, but this package appears to be completely proprietary. gdp and pifacecam These are two smaller packages, but they piqued my interest because both had stable ABI violations that weren\xe2\x80\x99t just the reference/counting helper APIs: dockerfile Finally, I liked this one because it turns out to be a Python extension written in Go, not C, C++, or Rust! The maintainer had the right idea, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t define Py_LIMITED_API to any particular value. So Python\xe2\x80\x99s headers \xe2\x80\x9chelpfully\xe2\x80\x9d interpreted that as not limited at all: The path forward First, the silver lining: most of the extremely popular packages in the list had no ABI violations or version mismatches. Cryptography and bcrypt were spared, for example, indicating strong build controls on their side. Other relatively popular packages had version violations, but they were generally minor (for example: expecting a function that was only stabilized with 3.7, but has been present and the same since 3.3). Overall, however, these results are not great: they indicate (1) that a significant portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cabi3\xe2\x80\x9d wheels on PyPI aren\xe2\x80\x99t really abi3-compatible at all (or are compatible with a different version than they claim), and (2) that maintainers don\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand the different knobs that control abi3 tagging (and that those knobs do not actually modify the build itself). More generally, the results point to a need for better controls, better documentation, and better interoperation between Python\xe2\x80\x99s different packaging components. In nearly all cases, the package\xe2\x80\x99s maintainer has attempted to do the right thing, but seemingly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of the additional steps necessary to actually build an abi3-compatible wheel. In addition to improving the package-side tooling here, the auditing is also automatable: we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed abi3audit in part to demonstrate that it would be possible for PyPI to catch these kinds of wheel errors before they become a part of the public index.

81,Software Mimicry (hillelwayne.com),https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/software-mimicry/,64,"b""Software Mimicry \xe2\x80\xa2 Hillel Wayne Skip to Content Blog Projects Talks Consulting About Tipjar Newsletter Hillel Wayne Software Mimicry Contact via Email Open Twitter account in new tab Open Github account in new tab Posted on Aug 29, 2022 Mimicry is when software X reimplements at a higher level a core feature of software Y. The produced facsimile has some, but not all, of the same properties, enough to \xe2\x80\x9clook like\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing but missing many of the nuances. This exists in every kind of software. One language can mimic another, a library can mimic a language, a database engine can mimic a product, etc. Example Design Patterns introduces the strategy pattern to apply multiple algorithms to the same call: INTENT: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. [\xe2\x80\xa6] a Strategy object encapsulates an algorithm. In Design Patterns in Dynamic Programming, Peter Norvig notes that strategies are just trivially replacable with higher-order functions (HOFs). Compare the algorithm \xe2\x80\x9cselect for all of the even numbers of a list\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9cGoF language\xe2\x80\x9d, as compared to how you\xe2\x80\x99d do with HOFs: // GoF pseudocode abstract class Strategy[T, U] { public execute(t: T): U; } class IsEven inherits Strategy[Int, Bool] { public execute(i: Int): Bool {return i % 2;} } def filter(pred: Strategy[T, Bool], l: List[T]): List[T] { // ... } filter(IsEven(), [1,2,3]) -> 2 // JavaScript [1,2, 3].filter((x) => x % 2 == 0) For this reason, design patterns are often (erroneously) called \xe2\x80\x9cmissing language features\xe2\x80\x9d. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more interesting to think of the GoF-language as mimicking HOFs with the strategy pattern facsimile. The strategy pattern reimplements HOFs as a code-level idiom. Benefits and Drawbacks The obvious drawback is that the facsimile is considerably more verbose; in our case, a hundred characters to fifteen. It\xe2\x80\x99s also fragile, as it only works for unary functions. If we wanted to pass in a function with two inputs, like Add, we\xe2\x80\x99d need to define a new strategy. The biggest drawback is that the facsimile doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d with the rest of the language. Program features are supposed to complement each other. In the JavaScript example, I used an HOF along with an anonymous function. The two features work together and with the broader language ecosystem. In contrast, our strategy facsimile is a custom class. It won\xe2\x80\x99t synergize with anything else in the language, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t be understood by third party tooling. Surprisingly, there are also a couple of advantages to mimicry. There are many possible ways to design a feature. JavaScript, Haskell, and F# all do HOFs in slightly different ways, and using those languages fixes the way you use HOFs. Mimicking a feature at a user level lets us use several different designs in the same program. For example, in addition to Strategy, I might define StrategyWithSetup: class StrategyWithSetup inherits Strategy[T, U] { public do(t: T): U { setup(); execute(t); teardown(); } private setup, teardown; // blah blah blah } The biggest advantage is that you still have the rest of the mimicking language. If the GoF language does 99% of what you need, and you just want HOFs for one specific case, it\xe2\x80\x99s better to create a facsimile than to switch everything over to Haskell. So mimicry can be a pragmatic choice to make a tool more \xe2\x80\x9cright for the job\xe2\x80\x9d. Mimicry in the Wild The most famous and notorious case of mimicry is Lisp macros. Lisp macros can extend the language with new constructs, so any language feature can be reimplemented as a lisp macro. This is why Paul Graham calls Lisp the most powerful language: By induction, the only programmers in a position to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the most powerful one. (This is probably what Eric Raymond meant about Lisp making you a better programmer.) You can\xe2\x80\x99t trust the opinions of the others, because of the Blub paradox: they\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs. The five languages that Eric Raymond recommends to hackers fall at various points on the power continuum. [\xe2\x80\xa6] I think Lisp is at the top. And to support this claim I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about one of the things I find missing when I look at the other four languages. How can you get anything done in them, I think, without macros? This also leads to the Lisp Curse: since everybody can make their own facsimile of a given feature, there\xe2\x80\x99s no agreement in the broader community of which facsimile to get behind, so no way to target tooling or build an ecosystem. Mimicry appears in other languages, too: static-typed languages can mimic dynamic languages with a Dyn type, leading to the (misleading) meme \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic languages have just one type\xe2\x80\x9d. Before Go added generics, people would mimic generics with interface{}, code generators, and unicode trickery. JML creates a facsimile of language-level contracts with structured comments. This Clojure article implements facsimiles of several APL features without understanding how they actually work. And, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s Greenspun\xe2\x80\x99s Tenth Rule. Mimicry also appears in higher-level software. Most IDEs have a \xe2\x80\x9cvim mode\xe2\x80\x9d which mimics most of vim\xe2\x80\x99s normal commands and some configuration, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support things like first-class macros. People use Postgres json fields to mimic NoSQL paradigms. Whenever I change email software I have to make facsimiles of all the features the new software has that the old one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Similar Ideas \xe2\x80\x9cRepresentation\xe2\x80\x9d is similar to mimicry, except it\xe2\x80\x99s about encoding a data structure in primitives that aren\xe2\x80\x99t well-suited to it. Examples would be representing a tree in SQL tables, representing a matrix with nested arrays, or representing a graph in json. The opposite of mimicry would be \xe2\x80\x9creification\xe2\x80\x9d, where you turn an idiom into a software feature. My favorite example is units of measure. Lots of languages have libraries or comment annotations to represent units of measure, but only two languages, F# and Frink, turn it into an actual language feature. Another example: Rust reifies the borrow checker, which was inspired by Cyclone, a dialect of C. Miscellaneous Thoughts So some other things this made me think about, but haven\xe2\x80\x99t fully developed: Often people will use mimicry to call something uninteresting: \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal about loops? That\xe2\x80\x99s just if and goto.\xe2\x80\x9c. This is rightly called out when it\xe2\x80\x99s someone else doing it to us. Mimicry often involves facsimiling the most obvious features of a language but not the nuances. Which ties back to the idea that languages are holistic, as are mimics. On the other hand, lots of people try Haskell because they got a taste of pure typed FP from language facsimiles. Mimicry can be a form of idea diffusion. Facsimiles can be exported: Someone who knows X reimplements a feature in language Y. They can also be imported: Someone who knows Y implements a feature they saw in language X. The difference is that in the former case, they\xe2\x80\x99re most familiar with the thing they\xe2\x80\x99re mimicking, while in the latter case they\xe2\x80\x99re most familiar with the mimicking context. Do these lead to observably different facsimiles? I regularly mimic relational databases in Excel spreadsheets and feel no shame whatsoever. Admittedly half the point of this post was to try out this format for sharing terms of I have. I often come up with terms for things I see a lot that I think might be useful for other people to have, too. Overall I think this particular format worked out, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably do more terms in the future. Thanks to Predrag Gruevski, Quinn Wilton, and Lars Hupel for feedback.

83,Foreign Dispatch: Ideas from code editors applied to foreign language writing (vangberg.name),https://harry.vangberg.name/posts/foreign-dispatch/,60,"b'Harry Vangberg - Foreign Dispatch Harry Vangberg Blog TILs RSS Blog TILs Foreign Dispatch Can ideas from code editors be applied to writing in foreign languages? Published November 17, 2022 When you learn a new language, different skills must be practiced: reading, listening, speaking, writing. Writing is the one I find most difficult, involving a lot of friction and context switching. Foreign Dispatch is a new project, where I will build tools to make foreign language writing easier. When I sit down to write a text in German, my goals are not the same as when I speak with another person. I want to expand my vocabulary, and learn how to express thoughts that I am currently unable to. I also want to focus on the grammar, making sure that I use the correct articles, and that my adjective endings are as they should be (no small feat in German), amongst many other things. This means that I spend a lot of time looking up words in dictionaries, checking my grammar book or searching the internet for how to write something in an idiomatic way. The constant context switching between my word processor and other tools was killing whatever flow I might have had. I realized that code editors solve many of the same problems. Autocomplete lets programmers look up functions without consulting the documention, while linters suggest improvements. Leveraging the type system, code editors show information about variables or functions: what kind they are or what they do. Could a code editor be extended to make writing in foreign languages easier? Autocomplete in VS Code ESLint in VS Code Documentation lookup in VS Code With Foreign Dispatch I want to try to answer that question, by building a number of small prototypes, each exploring a different aspect of foreign language writing. The first prototype is Autocomplete, a small CodeMirror based editor. It allows you to look up words in an English-German dictionary without leaving the text editor. Instead, you type \xe2\x80\x9c@\xe2\x80\x9d followed by the English word, which will look up German translations, much like autocomplete in a code editor. Video Foreign Dispatch Autocomplete in action The code is availabe on GitHub, or you can try the online demo. The dictionary is based on data from excellent WikDict project, which provides data from Wiktionary as SQLite databases. What\xe2\x80\x99s next After autocomplete, I want to tackle the prose equivalents of a linter and inline documentation. The linter should propose grammar fixes, and possibly suggest more idiomatic ways of expressing something. I have experimented a bit with using GPT-3 to suggest grammar corrections, and have found that it does a much better job, than whatever is in e.g.\xc2\xa0Word or Google Docs at the moment. Inline documentation is a bit more straightforward. Starting with German, I want to show word definitions, but also things such as noun gender and conjugation tables for verbs. The data that I need is available in WikDict. If the individual experiments turn out well, I would ultimately want to package up everything in a single web app, or create a language server that could be used from code editors such as VS Code, coming full circle.

It targets pornography, borderline sexualized content, as well as other graphic images that are not safe for work (NSFW) or may be inappropriate for children. Further, for those who wish to enable it, this plugin integrates with Cloudflare\'s ""1.1.1.1 for Families"" to provide DNS-level blocking as an extra line of defense!Please visit the blog for updates! https://wingman-jr.blogspot.com/There are a few known limitations:-AI is still far from perfect. Good images will sometimes be blocked. Bad images will sometimes slip through. Some general categories such as swimming, yoga, and certain sports are particularly troublesome. The current strategy is to be conservative on blocking, favoring blocking more than blocking less.-Running the image scanning algorithm requires a lot of work, which takes time. This will affect browser startup time and image loads will be slow.-The way images are intercepted and scanned works most of the time but there are exceptions.-Small, and broken images are passed through.-Video has limited support.When the addon starts, it will prompt about a hidden tab - this is normal, the hidden tab acts like a web page so it can best use your computer\'s graphics processor.Thanks for checking it out and I hope you enjoy it!Developer commentsPlease feel free to report bugs at the GitHub page: https://github.com/wingman-jr-addon/wingman_jrRate your experienceHow are you enjoying Wingman Jr. Filter?Log in to rate this extensionThere are no ratings yetStar rating savedReport this add-on for abuseReport this add-on for abuseIf you think this add-on violates Mozilla\'s add-on policies or has security or privacy issues, please report these issues to Mozilla using this form.Please don\'t use this form to report bugs or request add-on features; this report will be sent to Mozilla and not to the add-on developer.DismissSend abuse reportRead all 16 reviewsPermissionsLearn moreThis add-on needs to:Control browser proxy settingsHide and show browser tabsAccess your data for all websitesMore informationAdd-on LinksHomepageSupport siteSupport EmailVersion3.3.1Size15.18 MBLast updated5 days ago (Nov 15, 2022)Related CategoriesPhotos, Music & VideosPrivacy & SecurityLicenseCustom LicensePrivacy PolicyRead the privacy policy for this add-onVersion HistorySee all versionsAdd to collectionSelect a collection\xe2\x80\xa6Create new collectionRelease notes for 3.3.1This is a small bugfix release.- Fixed issue with private mode where image scanning would not always workMore extensions by ZephyrThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetThere are no ratings yetGo to Mozilla\'s homepageAdd-onsAboutFirefox Add-ons BlogExtension WorkshopDeveloper HubDeveloper PoliciesCommunity BlogForumReport a bugReview GuideBrowsersDesktopMobileEnterpriseProductsBrowsersVPNRelayMonitorPocketTwitter (@firefox)Instagram (Firefox)YouTube (firefoxchannel)PrivacyCookiesLegalExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License v3.0 or any later version.Change languageAfrikaans\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa8\xd9\x8aAsturianuAz\xc9\x99rbaycanca\xd0\x91\xd1\x8a\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xe0\xa6\xac\xe0\xa6\xbe\xe0\xa6\x82\xe0\xa6\xb2\xe0\xa6\xbeBosanskiCatal\xc3\xa0Maya Kaqchikel\xc4\x8ce\xc5\xa1tinaDanskDeutschDolnoserb\xc5\xa1\xc4\x87ina\xce\x95\xce\xbb\xce\xbb\xce\xb7\xce\xbd\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xacEnglish (Canadian)English (British)English (US)Espa\xc3\xb1olEesti keelEuskara\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8csuomiFran\xc3\xa7aisFryskGaeilge\xd7\xa2\xd7\x91\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\xaaHrvatskiHornjoserbscemagyarInterlinguaBahasa Indonesia\xc3\xadslenskaItaliano\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e\xe1\x83\xa5\xe1\x83\x90\xe1\x83\xa0\xe1\x83\x97\xe1\x83\xa3\xe1\x83\x9a\xe1\x83\x98Taqbaylit\xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4lietuvi\xc5\xb3 kalbaLatvie\xc5\xa1u\xd0\x9c\xd0\xb0\xd0\xba\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb4\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\x9c\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbbMelayuMaltiNorsk bokm\xc3\xa5lNederlandsNorsk nynorsk\xe0\xa8\xaa\xe0\xa9\xb0\xe0\xa8\x9c\xe0\xa8\xbe\xe0\xa8\xac\xe0\xa9\x80 (\xe0\xa8\xad\xe0\xa8\xbe\xe0\xa8\xb0\xe0\xa8\xa4)PolskiPortugu\xc3\xaas (do\xc2\xa0Brasil)Portugu\xc3\xaas (Europeu)Rom\xc3\xa2n\xc4\x83\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\xe0\xb7\x83\xe0\xb7\x92\xe0\xb6\x82\xe0\xb7\x84\xe0\xb6\xbdsloven\xc4\x8dinaSloven\xc5\xa1\xc4\x8dinaShqipSvenska\xe0\xb0\xa4\xe0\xb1\x86\xe0\xb0\xb2\xe0\xb1\x81\xe0\xb0\x97\xe0\xb1\x81\xe0\xb9\x84\xe0\xb8\x97\xe0\xb8\xa2T\xc3\xbcrk\xc3\xa7e\xd0\xa3\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x97\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd1\x8c\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd8\xa7\xd9\x8f\xd8\xb1\xd8\xaf\xd9\x88Ti\xe1\xba\xbfng Vi\xe1\xbb\x87t\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 (\xe7\xae\x80\xe4\xbd\x93)\xe6\xad\xa3\xe9\xab\x94\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 (\xe7\xb9\x81\xe9\xab\x94)'"

My purpose is (\xe2\x80\xa6..) but to consider the Calvary toward which idolaters of themselves are on a fatal course.\xe2\x80\x9d (J. L. B.) Intention. I want to tear down the exceptional preeminence now generally awarded to the self, and I pledge to be spurred on by concrete certainty, and not the caprice of an ideological ambush or a dazzling intellectual prank. I propose to prove that personality is a mirage maintained by conceit and custom, without metaphysical foundation or visceral reality. I want to apply to literature the consequences that issue from these premises, and erect upon them an aesthetic hostile to the psychologism inherited from the last century [1], sympathetic to the classics, yet encouraging to today\xe2\x80\x99s most unruly tendencies. Course of action. I have noticed that, in general, the acquiescence conceded by a man in the role of reader to a rigorous dialectical linkage is no more than a slothful inability to gauge the proofs the writer adduces and a vague trust in the latter\xe2\x80\x99s rectitude. But once the book has been closed and the reading has dispersed, little remains in his memory except a more or less arbitrary synthesis of the whole reading. To avoid this evident disadvantaged, I will, in the following paragraphs, cast aside all strict and logical schemas, and amass a pile of examples. There is no whole self. Any of life\xe2\x80\x99s present situations is seamless and sufficient. Are you, as you ponder these disquietudes, anything more than an indifference gliding over the argument I make, or an appraisal of the opinions I expound? I, as I write this, am only a certainty that seeks out the words that are most apt to compel your attention. The proposition and a few muscular sensations, and the sight of the limpid branches that the trees place outside my window, constitute my current I. It would be vanity to suppose that in order to enjoy absolute validity this psychic aggregate must seize on a self, that conjectural Jorge Luis Borges on whose tongue sophistries are always at the ready and in whose solitary strolls the evenings on the fringes of the city are pleasant. There is no whole self. He who defines personal identity as the private possession of some depository of memories is mistaken. Whoever affirms such a thing is abusing the symbol that solidifies memory in the form of an enduring and tangible granary or warehouse, when memory is no more than the noun by which we imply that among the innumerable possible states of consciousness, many occur again in an imprecise way. Moreover, if I root personality in remembrance, what claim of ownership can be made on the elapsed instants that, because they were quotidian or stale, did not stamp us with a lasting mark? Heaped up over years, they lie buried, inaccessible to our avid longing. And that much-vaunted memory to whose ruling you made appeal, does it ever manifest all its past plenitude? Does it truly live? The sensualists and their ilk, who conceive of your personality as the sum of your successive states of mind, are similarly deceiving themselves. On closer scrutiny, their formula is no more than an ignominious circumlocution that undermines the very foundation it constructs, an acid that eats away at itself, a prattling fraud and a belabored contradiction. No one will pretend that, in the glance by which we take in a limpid night, the exact number of visible stars is prefigured. No one, on thinking about it, will accept that the self can depend on the hypothetical and never realized nor realizable sum of different states of mind. What is not carried out does not exist; the linkage of events in a temporal succession does not refer to an absolute order. They err, as well, who suppose that the negation of personality I am urging with such obstinate zealotry refutes the certainty of being the isolated, individualized, and distinct thing that each of us feels in the depths of his soul. I do not deny this consciousness of being, nor the immediate security of here I am that it breathes into us. What I do deny is that all our other convictions must be adjusted to the customary antithesis between the self and the non-self, and that this antithesis is constant. The sensation of cold, of spacious and pleasurable suppleness, that is in me as I open the front door and go out along the half-darkness of the street is neither a supplement to a pre-existing self nor an event that comes coupled to the other event of a continuing and rigorous self. Moreover, even if the aforementioned reasons are misguided, I would refuse to surrender, for your conviction of being an individuality is in all ways identical to mine and to that of any human specimen, and there is no way to separate them. There is no whole self. It suffices to walk any distance along the inexorable rigidity that the mirrors of the past open to us in order to feel like outsiders, naively flustered by our own bygone days. There is no community of intention in them, nor are they propelled by the same breeze. This has been declared by those men who have truly scrutinized the calendars from which time was discarding them. Some, extravagant as fireworks, make a boast of so muddled a confusion and say that disparity is wealth; others, far from glorifying disorder, deplore the inequality of their days and yearn for the popular uniformity. I will copy out two examples. The first bears the date 1531; it is the epigraph to De Incertitudine et Vanitate Scientiarum, composed by the Kabbalist and astrologer Agrippa of Nettesheim in the disillusioned latter days of his life. He says: \xe2\x80\x9cAmong gods, all are shaken by the jeers of Momus. Among heroes, Hercules gives chase to all the monsters. Among demons, Pluto, the King of Hell, oppresses all the shades. While Heraclitus weeps at everything, Pyrrho knows naught of anything, And Aristotle glories in knowing all. Diogenes spurns the things of this world, And I, Agrippa, am foreign to none of this. I disdain, I know, I do not know, I pursue, I laugh, I tyrannize, I protest. I am philosopher, god, hero, demon and the whole universe.\xe2\x80\x9d The second testimonial comes from the third part of Torres Villarroel\xe2\x80\x99s Vida e Historia. This systematizer of Quevedo, learned in astrology, lord and master of all words, expert wielder of the most strident rhetorical figures, also sought to define himself and probed his fundamental incongruence. He saw that he was like everyone else: that is, that he was no one, or little more than an unintelligible cacophony, persisting in time and wearing out in space. He wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI am angry, fearful, compassionate, joyous, sad, greedy, generous, enraged, meek, and all the good and bad emotions and all the praiseworthy and reprehensible actions that can be found in all men together or separately. I have tried out all the vices and all the virtues, and in a single day I feel inclined to weep and laugh, give and keep, repose and suffer, and I am always unaware of the cause and the momentum of these contrarieties. I have heard this alternative of contrary impulses called madness; if it be so, we are all mad to a greater or lesser degree for I have noticed this unforeseen and repeated alternation in everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no whole self. Beyond all possibility of bombastic gamesmanship, I have touched this hard truth with my own emotions as I was separating from a companion. I was returning to Buenos Aires and leaving him behind in Mallorca. We both understood that, except in the perfidious or altered proximity of letters, we would not meet again. What happens at such moments happened. We knew this good-bye would jut out in our memories, and there was even a period when we tried to enhance its flavor with a vehement show of opinions for the yearnings to come. The present moment was acquiring all the prestige and indeterminacy of the past\xe2\x80\xa6. But beyond any egotistical display, what clamored in my chest was the will to show my soul in its entirety to my friend. I would have wanted to strip myself of it and leave it there, palpitating. We went on talking and debating, on the brink of good-bye, until all at once, with an unsuspected strength of conviction, I understood that this personality, which we usually appraise at such an incompatibly exorbitant value, is nothing. The thought came over me that never would one full and absolute moment, containing all the others, justify my life, that all of my instants would be provisional phases, annihilators of the past turned to face the future, and that beyond the episodic, the present, the circumstantial, we were nobody. And I despised all mysterizing. The last century was rootedly subjective in its aesthetic manifestations. Its writers were more inclined to show off their personalities than to establish a body of work, an aphorism that is also applicable today to the teeming and highly acclaimed mob of those who profit from the glib embers of that century\xe2\x80\x99s bonfires. However, my purpose is not to lash out against one or the other of these groups, but to consider the Calvary toward which idolaters of themselves are on a fatal course. We have already seen that any state of mind, however opportunistic, can entirely fill up our attention, which is much the same as saying that it can form, in its brief and absolute term, our essence. Which, translated into the language of literature, means that to try to express oneself and to want to express the whole of life are one and the same thing. A strenuous, panting dash between the prodding of time and man, who, like Achilles in the illustrious conundrum formulated by Zeno of Elea, will always see himself in last place\xe2\x80\xa6 Whitman was the first Atlas who attempted to make this obstinacy a reality and take the world upon his shoulders. He believed he had only to enumerate the names of things in order to make their unique and surprising nature immediately palpable. Therefore, his poems, along with a great deal of fine rhetoric, string together garrulous series of words, sometimes repeated from geographic or history primers, which kindle lofty signs of admiration and mimic great enthusiasm. From Whitman on, many have been caught up in this same fallacy. They have said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have not tormented the language in quest of unexpected intensities or verbal marvels. I have not spun out even a slight paradox capable of creating a stir in your conversation or sending its sparks out through your laborious silence. Nor did I invent a tale around which lengthy spans of attention would cluster, as many futile hours cluster in remembrance around one hour in which there was love. None of that did I do nor have I determined to do and yet I wish for enduring fame. My justification is as follows: I am a man astonished by the abundance of the world: I bear witness to the unicity of things. Like the most illustrious of men, my life is located in space, and the chiming of unanimous clocks punctuates my duration in time. The words I use are not redolent of far-flung readings, but signs that mark what I have felt or contemplated. If ever I made mention of the dawn, it was not merely to follow the easy current of usage. I can assure you that I know what the Dawn is: I have seen, with premeditated rejoicing, the explosion that hollows out the depths of the streets, incites the slums of the world to revolt, humiliates the stars and broadens the sky by many leagues. I also know what a jacaranda, a statue, a meadow, a cornice are\xe2\x80\xa6 I am like everyone else. This is my boast and my glory. It matters little whether I have proclaimed it in feeble verses or in rough-hewn prose.\xe2\x80\x9d The same is asserted, with greater skill and mastery, by painters. What is contemporary painting \xe2\x80\x93 that of Picasso and his pupils \xe2\x80\x93 but a rapt confirmation of the gorgeous unicity of a king of spades, a gatepost, or a chess board? Romantic ego-worship and loudmouthed individualism are in this way wreaking havoc on the arts. Thank God that the lengthy examination of spiritual minutiae that this demands of the artist forces him back to the eternal classic rectitude that is creation. In a book like Ram\xc3\xb3n G\xc3\xb3mez de la Serna\xe2\x80\x99s Greguer\xc3\xadas, the currents of both tendencies intermingle, and as we read we are unaware if what magnetizes our interest with such unique force is copied reality or is of pure intellectual fabrication. The self does not exist. Schopenhauer, who often appears to adhere to this opinion, at other times tacitly denies it, I know not whether deliberately or because he is compelled by the rough, homespun metaphysics \xe2\x80\x93 or rather a metaphysics \xe2\x80\x93 that lurks in the very origins of language. Nevertheless, despite this disparity, there is a passage in his work that illuminates the alternative like a sudden blast of flame. I shall transcribe it: \xe2\x80\x9cAn infinite time has run its course before my birth; what was I throughout all that time? Metaphysically, the answer might perhaps be: I was always I; that is, all who during that time said I, were in fact I.\xe2\x80\x9d Reality has no need of other realities to bolster it. There are no divinities hidden in the trees, nor any elusive thing-in-itself behind appearances, nor a mythological self that orders our actions. Life is truthful appearance. The senses do not deceive, it is the mind that deceives, said Goethe, in a maxim we could compare to this line by Macedonio Fern\xc3\xa1ndez: \xe2\x80\x9cLa realidad trabaja en abierto misterio\xe2\x80\x9d [Reality works in overt mystery] There is no whole self. Grimm, in an excellent presentation of Buddhism (Die Lehre des Buddha, Munich, 1917), describes the process of elimination whereby the Indians arrived at this certainty. Here is their millennially effective precept: \xe2\x80\x9cThose things of which I can perceive the beginnings and the end are not my self.\xe2\x80\x9d This rule is correct and needs only to be exemplified in order to persuade us of its virtue. I, for example, am not the visual reality that my eyes encompass, for if I were, darkness would kill me and nothing would remain in me to desire the spectacle of the world, or even to forget it. Nor am I the audible world that I hear, for in that case silence would erase me and I would pass from sound to sound without memory of the previous one. Subsequent identical lines of argument can be directed toward the senses of smell, taste, and touch, proving not only that I am not the world of appearances \xe2\x80\x93 a thing generally known and undisputed \xe2\x80\x93 but that the apperceptions that indicate that world are not my self either. That is, I am not my own activity of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching. Nor am I my body, which is a phenomenon among others. Up to this point the argument is banal; its distinction lies in its application to spiritual matters. Are desire, thought, happiness, and distress my true self? The answer, in accordance with the precept, is clearly in the negative, since those conditions expire without annulling me with them. Consciousness \xe2\x80\x93 the final hideout where we might track down the self \xe2\x80\x93 also proves unqualified. Once the emotions, the extraneous perceptions, and even ever-shifting thought are dismissed, consciousness is a barren thing, without any appearance reflected in it to make it exist. Grimm observes that this rambling dialectical inquiry yields a result that coincides with Schopenhauer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that the self is a point whose immobility is useful for discerning, by contrast, the heavy-laden flight of time. This opinion translates the self into a mere logical imperative, without qualities of its own or distinctions from individual to individual.

The North American version was revealed this week at the LA Auto Show.By Umar Shakir Nov 18, 2022, 10:49 PM UTC|Share this storyHyundai Ioniq 6 on stage at the LA Auto Show\xe2\x80\x99s press and trade event AutoMobility. Image: HyundaiHyundai\xe2\x80\x99s Ioniq 6 electric sedan made its official stateside debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show this week, revealing some new details on the US version. The Magic Mouse-shaped \xe2\x80\x9cstreamliner\xe2\x80\x9d car that was first unveiled this summer will have a max estimated driving range of 340 miles (not EPA-rated yet) on the rear-wheel-drive model.The range is a bit less than the initial 379-mile target announced and even further from the European WLTP estimates of 382 miles. Still, 340 miles is an excellent achievement, succeeding the Ioniq 5\xe2\x80\x99s 300-mile range while running on a similar 77.4kWh battery along with a shared E-GMP (Electric Global Modular Platform) architecture that underpins it.With E-GMP, the Ioniq 6 is one of few vehicles in the US with a fast 800-volt charging system, joining up with even fancier vehicles like the Porsche Taycan. Hyundai calculates that the battery can charge from 10 to 80 percent in just 18 minutes when connected to 350kW-capable charging stations. In colder weather, achieving the maximum charging speed requires the battery to be warm, so the Ioniq 6 can preheat the battery when navigation is pointed to a charging station.1/20Hyundai has a deal with Electrify America, one of the larger charging networks in the US, to provide unlimited 30-minute charging sessions for two years. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same offer that\xe2\x80\x99s handed out to new Ioniq 5 and Kona EV owners and is quite competitive compared to deals from other manufacturers, like $400 in credits for EVgo that Subaru Solterra customers get. Of course, free fast charging is only really useful if you road trip regularly. For most drivers, Level 2 (AC) charging at home is key, and the Ioniq 6 sports a 10.9kW onboard charger that\xe2\x80\x99s good for a full charge in about 7 hours and 10 minutes, according to Hyundai.Ioniq 6 can go the distance with other long-range EVs in the US, including the Tesla Model 3 AWD that offers about 358 miles of range, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Mustang Mach-E with 305 miles (California Route 1 RWD), BMW iX xDrive50 with 324 miles, and even Mercedes EQS with about 350 miles of range.There\xe2\x80\x99s more than 700 \xe2\x80\x9cParametric Pixels\xe2\x80\x9d LEDs in and around the car. Image: HyundaiThe rear wing has \xe2\x80\x9ceye-catching light execution\xe2\x80\x9d when braking. Image: HyundaiPart of the reason Ioniq 6 is great on range is due to efficiency. On the rear-wheel-drive model, Ioniq 6 only sheds about 14.3kWh of power per 62 miles driven, or about 231Wh per mile. That beats the 2022 Tesla Model 3 RWD, which has an EPA-estimated efficiency of 260Wh per mile (combined highway and city).Another factor that helps the Ioniq 6 go the distance is its excellent aerodynamics, calculated at a 0.22 drag coefficient. You may remember that the original calculation was a slightly lower 0.21, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because it was calculated on an Ioniq 6 with the Digital Side Mirrors that still aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet approved in the US. Cars equipped with this feature have slim camera housings in place of traditional side mirrors, sending a feed of what you would normally see out the window onto LCD displays on the extremities of your dashboard.Top: Ioniq 6 with traditional mirrors. Bottom: Not US-friendly digital side mirrors with cameras on the outside and displays on the inside. Images: HyundaiWhat you will be able to get in the US is an Ioniq 6 with a large 77.4kWh battery in either AWD or RWD flavors. The AWD is dual-motor with a 74kW front and 165kW rear motor setup that gives you 320 horsepower and a 0\xe2\x80\x9360 mph acceleration in less than five seconds. The RWD option offers 225 horsepower on a single 168kW motor but gives you the longest advertised range. The AWD has a slightly lower 310-mile estimated range.The Ioniq 6 will go on sale in the US in the spring of 2023. No pricing details have been revealed yet; the automaker says it will be announced closer to the on-sale date. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in living the nomadic, work-from-home-that-is-your-car lifestyle Hyundai is selling, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait long.Join the conversationMost PopularHundreds of employees say no to being part of Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98extremely hardcore\xe2\x80\x99 TwitterElon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s new email pushes Twitter managers to do his dirty workThe Arc browser is the Chrome replacement I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting forGeneral Motors says it will stop burning cash on electric vehicles by 2025Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s living wake kicked off with Elon\xe2\x80\x99s 5PM deadlineVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Cartwright uses deep learning, natural language processing, and a variety of heuristics to determine whether a column in a dataset contains spatial or temporal information and, if so, what is specifically contained. Cartwright was built to automate complex data pipelines for heterogenous climate and geopolitical data that are generally oriented around geospatial and temporal features (think maps and time series). The challenge that Cartwright solves is automatically detecting those features so they can be parsed and normalized. This problem turns out to be quite tricky, but Cartwright makes it simple. Cartwright can easily detect things like country, day, latitude, and many other location and time types. Check out Cartwright\'s supported categories for a complete listing! Cartwright is easy to install and works with pretty much any tabular data. It\'s easy to add new categories too! Learn more about the methodology behind Cartwright, its API, and how to contribute in our docs. Installation You can install Cartwright from PyPi with pip install cartwright. Using Cartwright Imagine we have the following weather dataset: x_value y_value recorded_at rainfall 7.942658 107.240322 07/14/1992 .2 7.943745 137.240633 07/15/1992 .1 7.943725 139.240664 07/16/1992 .3 To the human observer, it\'s pretty obvious that x_value is the longitude column, y_value the latitude, recorded_at the date, and rainfall the actual weather measurement. However, if we\'re trying to automatically ingest this data into a weather model, we would benefit from knowing this without human observation. Enter Cartwright: from pprint import pprint from cartwright import categorize cartwright = categorize.CartwrightClassify() categories = cartwright.categorize(path=""path/to/data.csv"") pprint(categories, sort_dicts=False) We\'ve now categoriezed each column in this dataset and have automatically determined which column represents latitude, longitude and date. We\'ve also learned the time format (%m/%d/%Y) of the date feature. {\'x_value\': {\'category\': <Category.geo: \'geo\'>, \'subcategory\': <Subcategory.longitude: \'longitude\'>, \'format\': None}, \'y_value\': {\'category\': <Category.geo: \'geo\'>, \'subcategory\': <Subcategory.latitude: \'latitude\'>, \'format\': None}, \'recorded_at\': {\'category\': <Category.time: \'time\'>, \'subcategory\': <Subcategory.date: \'date\'>, \'format\': \'%m/%d/%Y\'}} With this information we can now convert the date values to a timestamp and plot a timeseries with other features. Resolution Detection In addition to its ability to categorize spatial and temporal features, Cartwright can determine their resolution. For example, given a dataset like: date,temperature(C) 2019-01-01 00:00:00, 10.2 2019-01-01 02:00:00, 11.7 2019-01-01 04:00:00, 12.3 ... 2019-12-31 22:00:00, 10.1 Cartwright can detect it\'s temporal resolution: Resolution( uniformity=Uniformity.PERFECT, unit=TimeUnit.HOUR, resolution=2.0, error=0.0, ) For gridded data, which is common in the scientific domain, Cartwright can also determine the spatial resolution (grid size). Check out the docs to learn more about using Cartwright to detect temporal resolution and spatial resolution.

According to the tweet, he apparently had a stroke that left him comatose. Their doctor told them that between the damage from the stroke and the time in the coma, the odds of him waking up are nearly none and even if he did, he\'d be severely intellectually disabled/brain damaged. So the family made the choice to take him off support and let him pass peacefully. permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive awardreply[\xe2\x80\x93]Outside_Distance333 8 points9 points10 points 2 hours ago\xc2\xa0(0 children)I would prefer death over causing my family financial distress too.

His Forerunner trilogy is my favorite Halo trilogy across all media. That includes games. I just find Bear\xe2\x80\x99s worldbuilding by far the most effective in the entire franchise, his thematic storytelling is so very consistent and yet grandiose, and yet his prose is simple and grounded. I knew he was advanced in age when he was writing the Forerunner Trilogy, so I never really had hope he would return to the franchise, but I always thought it would be amazing if he did. Frankly, Kelly Gay is a great choice to write Halo: Epitaph, but she would\xe2\x80\x99ve been my second choice. Greg Bear would have been my first. I wish Bear and his family the very best. I hope his passing is peaceful, serene, painless, and full of love.

It's designed to do the same thing as the qemu-x86_64 command, except rather than being a 10mb binary, blink only has a ~142kb footprint. For further details on the motivations for this tool, please read https://justine.lol/ape.html. Getting Started You can compile blink on x86-64 Linux, Darwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Apple Silicon, and Raspberry Pi using your operating system's toolchain. # for all x86-64 platforms $ build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 o//blink/blink # for apple m1 arm silicon $ build/bootstrap/blink-darwin-arm64 build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 o//blink/blink # for linux raspberry pi $ build/bootstrap/blink-linux-aarch64 build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 o//blink/blink # run actually portable executable in virtual machine $ o//blink/blink third_party/cosmo/hello.com hello world # run static elf binary in virtual machine $ o//blink/blink third_party/cosmo/tinyhello.elf hello world There's a terminal interface for debugging: $ build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 o///blink/tui $ o//blink/tui -t third_party/cosmo/tinyhello.elf You can run our test executables to check your local platform build: $ build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 check For maximum performance, use MODE=release or MODE=opt. $ build/bootstrap/make.com MODE=opt -j8 check For maximum tinyness, use MODE=tiny. $ build/bootstrap/make.com MODE=tiny -j8 check $ strip o/tiny/blink/blink $ ls -hal o/tiny/blink/blink If you're building your code on an x86-64 Linux machine, then the following command will cross-compile blink for i386, arm, m68k, riscv, mips, s390x. Then it'll launch all the cross-compiled binaries in qemu to ensure the test programs above work on all architectures. $ build/bootstrap/make.com -j8 emulates $ o/third_party/qemu/qemu-aarch64 o//aarch64/blink/blink third_party/cosmo/hello.com hello world Technical Details blink is an x86-64 interpreter for POSIX platforms that's written in ANSI C11 that's compatible with C++ compilers. Instruction decoding is done using our trimmed-down version of Intel's disassembler Xed. Like Bochs, Blink doesn't do code generation; the primary focus is having a smaller binary footprint with a readable codebase. However we're still likely to add something like jit in the near future. The prime directive of this project is to act as a virtual machine for userspace binaries compiled by Cosmopolitan Libc. Much of the surface area of the Linux SYSCALL ABI is supported, including fork() and clone(). The SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, POPCNT, CLMUL, RDTSCP, and RDRND ISAs are supported. x87 currently only supports double (64-bit) precision. Blink supports 32-bit and 16-bit BIOS programs, plus just enough ring0 instructions to test an operating system bootloader. Plus IBM PC Serial UART, CGA, and MDA. However these legacy features might get sprung into a sister project sometime soon.

This is a coding game where you get a task, write a function to implement it and hope it is correct when you issue verify solution. My solutions are seldom correct on the first try but this time I was passing 4 out of 5 tests and my intuituion was that I was hitting a timeout. This was actually certain because the solution I coded was a O(2^n), oopsie! So I set to reimplement it to be O(n) and passed 3 out of 5 tests. To an untrained eye this may seems a step back but it is a step forward. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see the test result matrix and game our way out of this mess. test O(2^n) O(n) 1 pass pass 2 pass pass 3 fail pass 4 pass fail 5 pass fail The tests confirm our intution that test 3 was failing because of a timeout but now we have a regression as the O(n) solution fails test 4 and 5. As the two solutions fail on different tests we can use O(2^n) as an oracle when testing O(n) and find inputs that will trigger the bug because the results will be different. Instead of trying to come up with the input myself I decided it was the right time to try property testing. Property testing is a strategy where you come up with a property that must hold for all inputs and then generate inputs until the property does not hold. It is actually more complicated than that but for my use case of today (solving puzzles and writing this post) this description is enough. The property that we want to prove is that previous_solution and solution are functionally equivalent. This condition is also known as solution is a refinement of previous_solution. The test case we want to use is the following. import unittest from solution import solution from previous_solution import solution as previous_solution class TestSolution(unittest.TestCase): def test_refinement(self, xs): assert solution(xs) == previous_solution(xs) if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main() Now this test is useless by itself. The property we want to test, that the two implementations are functionally equivalent, is easy to express but the test_refinement method takes a parameter xs which is not defined anywhere and therefore we cannot really use it as it is. This is where the hypothesis library comes to save our day. By adding three lines of code we are now able to do property testing. import unittest +from hypothesis import given +import hypothesis.strategies as st from solution import solution from previous_solution import solution as previous_solution class TestSolution(unittest.TestCase): + @given(xs=st.lists(st.integers())) def test_refinement(self, xs): assert solution(xs) == previous_solution(xs)) if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main() The previous diff \xe2\x80\x9cupgrades\xe2\x80\x9d our test case by interposing the hypothesis library between the unittest runtime and the test method. Hypothesis will generate possible inputs xs following a recipe and feed them to our method repeatedly. In our case the recipe is simple. We generate a list of integers by composing two strategies that the library exposes. The decorator @given(xs=st.lists(st.integers())) is all we need to specify all possible inputs to our test. In matter of seconds hypothesis came up with an example list, [0, -1], where the result was not equal and I was able to correct the O(n) solution immediately. It is also very important to notice that what we did is just scratching the surface. I could have taken a totally different route by having more methods covering different properties, e.g. consing a positive integer to the list does bla, but this time I had an oracle to use and I was sure that I was missing a simple edge case. It can be very difficult to use hypothesis well and some tasks are not a good fit for property testing. Having an oracle ready can be a huge productivity bonus because the alternative is having to think really hard about the properties you want.

On the eve of a major revival of her work, this is the story of how she came to see a future that is now our present. On the 75th anniversary of her birth, the science-fiction writer\xe2\x80\x99s bold imagining of the future has proved startlingly prescient. Text by Lynell George Visuals by Ainslee Alem Robson Mural with a portrait of Octavia Butler and her name, composed of dots of various densities in 3-D space. All of the artwork in this story is in this style. Four students stand in front, gazing at her portrait. The point of view moves from the opposite side of the wall, through the mural, before moving behind the students as the dots fade away. Sixteen years after her death, the writer Octavia Butler is experiencing a renaissance. Butler, seen here on a mural at a middle school that bears her name, is celebrated for novels that grappled with extremism, racial justice and the climate crisis. The future she wrote about is now our present moment. What follows is a tour of the worlds that made her \xe2\x80\x94 and the worlds that she made. She wrote 12 novels and won each of science fiction\xe2\x80\x99s highest honors. In 1995, she became the first science fiction writer to be awarded a MacArthur \xe2\x80\x9cgenius\xe2\x80\x9d grant. The MacArthur Foundation said of Octavia E. Butler, \xe2\x80\x9cHer imaginative stories are transcendent fables, which have as much to do with the future as with the present and the past.\xe2\x80\x9d Part of what has made Butler so beloved is the work that preceded these honors: the way she envisioned her own future and encouraged herself to keep going despite the very real obstacles in her path. She recorded her goals and aspirations in her personal journals in terms that have since resonated across the decades: I will buy a beautiful home in an excellent neighborhood. I will help poor Black youngsters broaden their horizons. I will travel whenever and wherever in the world that I choose. My books will be read by millions of people! So be it! See to it! With great discipline, she engaged honestly with a set of questions about who she was and where she was going. Her responses were intended for her publisher \xe2\x80\x94 and ultimately for the world \xe2\x80\x94 but they were written especially for herself. While drafting one autobiographical note, she described herself as \xe2\x80\x9ca hermit in the middle of Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 a pessimist if I\xe2\x80\x99m not careful, a feminist, always a Black, a quiet egoist, a former Baptist and an oil-and-water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty and drive.\xe2\x80\x9d She is also, increasingly, a writer recognized as one of the most important voices and visionaries of the 20th century, and now the 21st. Since her death at 58 in 2006, after a fall outside her home in Lake Forest Park, Wash., her novels have inspired art installations, librettos and jazz suites. They now appear on university syllabuses and high school reading lists. Her extensive archives, housed primarily at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif., contain her voluminous notebooks and meticulous research. She led the way for the next generation of Black readers, thinkers and builders to picture themselves in the collective future, laying the groundwork for an Afrofuturist movement before the term even existed. Five adaptations of her fiction are currently in various stages of film and television development, by producers ranging from J.J. Abrams and Issa Rae to Ava DuVernay. \xe2\x80\x9cKindred,\xe2\x80\x9d her now canonical 1979 novel about a Black woman who is yanked back in time to the antebellum South and marooned on a working plantation, will premiere as a TV series from FX in December, adapted by the playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins. In 2020, in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, many readers turned to Butler\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 novel \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower,\xe2\x80\x9d which details the journey of a visionary and headstrong teenager, Lauren Olamina, set against a California landscape besieged by climate change and socio-economic crises \xe2\x80\x94 so many readers, in fact, that the novel appeared on the New York Times best-seller list, a first for Butler, fulfilling her stated lifelong dream 14 years after her death. As a Black woman and a writer, Butler demolished walls that seemed impermeable, writing on themes that seemed uncategorizable. This year marks the 75th anniversary of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s birth. Her themes, ideas and characters continue to resonate with new readers at a time when so many are looking for, if not hope, then a map for a way forward. What readers, fans and scholars often note about Butler\xe2\x80\x99s work is its predictive qualities: Her vision about the climate crisis, political and societal upheaval and the brutality and consequences of power hierarchies seems both sobering and prescient. But, as Butler often noted, being right was never the point. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be right \xe2\x80\x94 far from it. She wanted to give us time, and tools, to correct the course. The Beginning 1947\xe2\x80\x931959 The World That Made Her The World That Made Her The point of view pans out from the side of the Los Angeles Central Library, before turning to reveal the front facade. As the viewpoint zooms out, points come into focus as trees. The viewpoint pulls out to show foliage and trees along with a blue tiled sign of Los Angeles Public Library. As a young woman living in Pasadena, Octavia Butler often took the long bus ride into the busy maze of downtown Los Angeles to visit the multistory Central Library. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a writer at least partly because I had access to public libraries,\xe2\x80\x9d she later reflected. \xe2\x80\x9cI am also a product of librarians who read stories to groups of avid little kids.\xe2\x80\x9d Octavia Estelle Butler was the daughter of a shoeshine man, who died when she was a baby, and a maid. A self-described loner, Butler always stood apart: far from the loud tangle of children at recess, standing in the shade of the generous sycamore and oak trees of Pasadena or secreted inside her bedroom in the after-school hours, lost within some exotic elsewhere of storybooks. Some of the books were her own, saved up for, while others were hand-me-down castoffs rescued by her mother, who scrubbed, dusted and ironed in houses in the majority white and wealthy Pasadena neighborhoods that were adjacent, yet worlds apart, from her own. Butler\xe2\x80\x99s mother walked her to the library, where they signed up for a card. That small slip of paper became her passport to travel widely. Boundlessly curious and a keen observer, Butler lived vividly in her imagination. The stories between the covers of those books served as a balm, providing locales within which she could disappear, occupy new settings, explore new possibilities and try on new characteristics. She began making up stories at 5 or 6 and regaling her mother with them. She read with thirst and purpose. She became a fixture at the Peter Pan Room, the children's section of the elegant Pasadena Central Library. When she\xe2\x80\x99d exhausted those shelves, she was dismayed to learn that the adult stacks were off limits until her 14th birthday. She developed workarounds. She saved up change, which sang in her pocket as she walked to the store to purchase her first books \xe2\x80\x94 about horses, dinosaurs and the stars she could barely see because of the scrim of Southern California smog. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I was trying to write about Mars,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled as an adult, \xe2\x80\x9cand I knew nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d The point of view pans through a work space, illuminated by four standing lamps. In the back are rows and rows of bookshelves. As the viewpoint moves forward through the space, the details of the green rug on the floor and spines of books become more visible. Once the viewpoint reaches the bookshelves, it turns right into one of the corridors, before the bookshelves dissolve and fade to black. Libraries, with their grand stacks and hidden carrels, were more than a safe space for Butler: They provided possibilities. Sitting in the hushed cocoon of the library gave shape and structure to her days. It gave her a role. It gave her purpose. Whenever Butler felt dispirited \xe2\x80\x94 about not having a mentor or a steady income or a clear path forward \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99d remind herself that she always had two things: her desire and access to aisle upon aisle of books. At school, Butler struggled to find her footing, but the sciences captivated her. They hinted at something larger \xe2\x80\x94 a series of open questions. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked science documentaries, whether they were television movies or the kinds of films that teachers showed at school,\xe2\x80\x9d she once said. She recalled that moment when the world fell away, after the teachers rolled in the AV equipment, the lights dimmed and the projector started to whir. \xe2\x80\x9cI got my first notions of astronomy and geology from those little films,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. These visions transported her far away from Pasadena and the hemmed-in feeling she often fought. At the edge of the Angeles National Forest, she could see NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a cutting-edge institution that attracted scientists from all over the world. But her Pasadena \xe2\x80\x94 the segregated city of her childhood \xe2\x80\x94 seemed to occupy an entirely different universe. Her imagination, she knew, was a means to escape this cul-de-sac of despair. But she needed a plan. The point of view moves through the front windshield of a bus, passing rows of seats inside, before reaching the back of the bus, where the San Gabriel mountains are visible through the back window. Then the bus dissolves and fades to black. For Butler, the bus in Pasadena was a necessary link from here to there. Sitting high above the cars, she could take in the shifting landscapes: It gave her a window into different worlds. On the bus, she might find herself drawn into a conversation, or eavesdropping on an exchange that would ignite a new idea. She\xe2\x80\x99d flip open a notebook, careful to catch a stray idea, if only a seed of a seed \xe2\x80\x94 afraid that it might slip away. \xe2\x80\x9cLos Angeles is so spread out that almost any bus ride will be a long one,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler once observed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time proved perfect for writing.\xe2\x80\x9d Her bus rides also allowed her to make sketches of potential characters. \xe2\x80\x9cI especially collect people \xe2\x80\x94 those who stand out in some way,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. In Pasadena, Butler was surrounded by hills and mountains, and she\xe2\x80\x99d watch them change from green to brown. The magnolia and pomegranate trees grew heavy with blooms or fruit, and she carried pocket-size memo pads to record their growth, from year-to-year \xe2\x80\x94 gauging how well, or poorly, the trees were doing. She saw how important it was to nurture the natural world. This too was part of a larger story she was investigating, about the changing earth. At her mother\xe2\x80\x99s urging, she wrote her stories down \xe2\x80\x94 on stray sheets of scrap paper, on waste bin letterhead or in her dime store notebooks. In an act that was viewed as wildly indulgent by her extended family, Octavia Margaret, Butler\xe2\x80\x99s mother, presented her daughter, Estelle (as her family called her), with a typewriter for her 11th birthday: a heavy, manual behemoth that she had no clue how to operate. But it was a powerful talisman \xe2\x80\x94 a symbol of seriousness. She hunted and pecked a path forward. Late one night, Butler happened to tune into a broadcast of a campy, science fiction B movie titled \xe2\x80\x9cDevil Girl From Mars.\xe2\x80\x9d At 12 years old, sitting in the blue glow of the family\xe2\x80\x99s new television, she thought the film was a revelation: It was spectacularly bad. Someone got paid to write this, she thought. Imagine that. The Breakthrough 1978\xe2\x80\x931979 Where \xe2\x80\x98Kindred\xe2\x80\x99 Came From Where \xe2\x80\x98Kindred\xe2\x80\x99 Came From At her writing table, focused on the future, the adult Butler often questioned and re-questioned: Are we ever free of our past? Not just of our personal choices \xe2\x80\x94 the boons or blunders \xe2\x80\x94 but of the uncomfortable histories we inherit, and the ways in which we are inexorably tied to them? She had long since left behind the fantasy stories and horse romances she wrote as a girl to turn her attention to science fiction \xe2\x80\x94 to the forms and shapes of the stories she had read in magazines such as Amazing Stories, Fantastic and Galaxy Science Fiction. Here, she would find her voice, her way, her purpose. The blank page now had depth for her. Writing felt like leaping into vast, deep water. Without limits, where might she travel? Having published several novels and built a small following, Butler used the meager, hard-won funds she\xe2\x80\x99d earned from the sale of her most recent book, 1978\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSurvivor,\xe2\x80\x9d to embark on her first research trip. She traveled by Trailways and Greyhound buses to Maryland for library research and to take in the physical world of a plantation. During her trip, she was struck by the erasure she witnessed on a visit to George and Martha Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Mount Vernon home, where tour guides never referred to \xe2\x80\x9cslaves,\xe2\x80\x9d instead calling them \xe2\x80\x9cservants.\xe2\x80\x9d Butler later wrote that her research made the book that came out of this trip one of the most difficult for her to live with, as she absorbed the losses, the grief and the slave-narrative voices of the dead. The finished novel became one of her best-known books: the genre-defying 1979 classic \xe2\x80\x9cKindred.\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x9cKindred,\xe2\x80\x9d the main character, Edana \xe2\x80\x9cDana\xe2\x80\x9d Franklin, is a struggling Black writer who is setting up her new house with her white husband, Kevin, when she unexpectedly travels through a mysterious seam in time from her life in contemporary Southern California to a working plantation in the antebellum South. Throughout the novel, she is whipsawed back and forth between the two eras, dropped repeatedly into a violent landscape that she comes to understand is not simply occupied by her forebears but is, in fact, her inheritance. Butler always described \xe2\x80\x9cKindred\xe2\x80\x9d not as science fiction but as a \xe2\x80\x9cgrim fantasy.\xe2\x80\x9d It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t contain the genre\xe2\x80\x99s typical trappings or devices; there is no time machine, no hard science. In a clear, creative sense, Butler saw history itself as an otherworldly landscape to be explored: foreign yet familiar. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Kindred\xe2\x80\x99 was a story of ordinary people trapped in fantastic circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler wrote in a 1988 notebook. The antebellum South was \xe2\x80\x9clike another planet to Dana and Kevin \xe2\x80\x94 people of \xe2\x80\x98now.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no book like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, the playwright and screenwriter who is adapting \xe2\x80\x9cKindred\xe2\x80\x9d for FX. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I revisited \xe2\x80\x98Kindred\xe2\x80\x99 in 2010, the book cracked open for me in a different way than it did when I first read it,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalled. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bPeople forget this book is 45 years old. People forget this is literally a half-century-old book.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he marveled, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s still immediate.\xe2\x80\x9d Cotton plants in a cotton field. The arms of two figures appear, with one hand gripping the hand of the other figure. They loom large among the environment, almost architecturally. As the point of view passes through the arms, the lone arm left in the frame dissolves before the rest of the cotton field fades away. While researching \xe2\x80\x9cKindred,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler toured the cotton fields of Maryland to shape her vision of how the past reaches out to the present, and how the histories of Black and white America interact. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this country,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler jotted in some stray notes while writing the novel, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether we like it or not, Blacks and whites are kindred.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cKindred\xe2\x80\x9d remains a portal, the doorway through which many readers \xe2\x80\x94 science fiction enthusiasts and beyond \xe2\x80\x94 first encounter Butler. However, the book also assertively advanced a larger discussion about the untended wound of slavery and how it shapes our present-day environment \xe2\x80\x94 our ability to create connections, to find community \xe2\x80\x94 in a way that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been attempted in fiction before. The novel endures in part because the bracing candor and brutal immediacy of the story meet contemporary readers where they are, said Ayana A.H. Jamieson, the founder of the Octavia E. Butler Legacy Network, a global community dedicated to Butler\xe2\x80\x99s work. \xe2\x80\x9cKindred\xe2\x80\x9d encourages readers to grapple with hard questions about kinship and alliances, and about what it means to survive. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of the underlying message of this book,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jamieson, \xe2\x80\x9cis while this is one person dealing with their own family history, it is also all of us.\xe2\x80\x9d Premonitions 1993\xe2\x80\x932006 A \xe2\x80\x98Parable\xe2\x80\x99 Foretold A \xe2\x80\x98Parable\xe2\x80\x99 Foretold \xe2\x80\x9cI began writing about power because I had so little,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler repeatedly asserted in her journals, in interviews and in conversations about her life as a writer. She was curious about how power worked, how it changed from hands to hands, always asking: What might her characters do with power? What might power grant them? She gave characters in her stories \xe2\x80\x94 often wily, adaptable women \xe2\x80\x94 the power and ability to fight using whatever means, modest contrivances or hidden superpowers they had. She also threw plenty of trouble at them to see how they might survive. This exercise in creativity closely mirrors Butler\xe2\x80\x99s own experience in life. What Butler\xe2\x80\x99s heroines have in common is the resourcefulness and grit to make something of nothing \xe2\x80\x94 the ability to problem-solve, time and time again. This same spirit animates the way in which many read Butler now: not just as a gifted storyteller but as someone who saw, in the distance, the crises we\xe2\x80\x99re now struggling to overcome. One novel that seems especially prescient is 1993\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower.\xe2\x80\x9d Like Dana in \xe2\x80\x9cKindred,\xe2\x80\x9d whose time-slipping irrevocably alters her present, Lauren Oya Olamina, the main character in \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower,\xe2\x80\x9d watches, aghast, as all that she has known vanishes: her family members, her community, her comforts and her way of life. Like Dana, Lauren is thrust into a life-or-death predicament that she must puzzle out to survive. But her tangle is not a contest with the past. Rather, it requires confronting a deeply uncertain future. Lauren, who is 15 at the novel\xe2\x80\x99s outset, lives in the fictional Southern California town of Robledo, a gated community 20 miles east of Los Angeles\xe2\x80\x99s glowing sprawl. Her hometown is in ruin, a war zone. Earth, as its residents have all known it, is descending into disaster \xe2\x80\x94 never-ending drought, social upheaval and violent class wars. Lauren begins keeping a journal in which she fashions verses that will become the foundation of a new faith: Earthseed, which embraces the inevitability of the change that continues to buffet, disrupt and radically reform her life. A cloud of orange-red smoke, before the point of view pulls back through a barren landscape of trees on fire. Dark red clouds emerge in the distance, and individual dots that comprise the trees and the greenery are illuminated, almost like sparks. In \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower,\xe2\x80\x9d Earth is tipping toward climate disaster: A catastrophic drought has led to social upheaval and violent class wars. Butler, a fervent environmentalist, researched the novel by clipping articles, taking notes and monitoring rain and growth in her Southern California neighborhood. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder, she later wrote, what \xe2\x80\x9cenvironmental and economic stupidities\xe2\x80\x9d might lead to. She often called herself a pessimist, but threaded into the bleak landscape of her \xe2\x80\x9cParable\xe2\x80\x9d novels are strands of glimmering hope \xe2\x80\x94 ribbons of blue at the edges of the fictional fiery skies. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are some of us who read the \xe2\x80\x98Parable of the Sower\xe2\x80\x99 (and its sequel the \xe2\x80\x98Parable of the Talents\xe2\x80\x99) as sacred text,\xe2\x80\x9d the author and activist adrienne maree brown, who uses all lowercase letters in her name, wrote on her website. Along with the musician Toshi Reagon, brown began hosting a podcast, \xe2\x80\x9cOctavia\xe2\x80\x99s Parables,\xe2\x80\x9d during the earliest months of the pandemic. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything she wrote is provocative and interesting, but in the \xe2\x80\x98Parables\xe2\x80\x99 she cuts in right next to her own story, and many of ours, a Black girl creator, surviving,\xe2\x80\x9d brown wrote. Butler saw these threads in her own work. \xe2\x80\x9cI seem to be saying something without trying,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Black women are survivors, that they have to be strong because so much is demanded of them,\xe2\x80\x9d something that \xe2\x80\x9cboth my mother and my grandmother discovered firsthand.\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower,\xe2\x80\x9d as Lauren ventures out into the world to find a new home, she collects a daisy chain of fellow travelers. Together they make their way toward freedom in a new settlement they christen Acorn. Lauren understands that Earth is suffering and that \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d lies elsewhere, even within them: \xe2\x80\x9cTrees are better than stone \xe2\x80\x94 life commemorating life,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. The Present 2004\xe2\x80\x932022 \xe2\x80\x98To Take Root Among the Stars\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98To Take Root Among the Stars\xe2\x80\x99 A barren landscape that becomes obscured in a cloud of points, before dispersing as the point of view pans through the legs of the Perseverance Rover on the terrain of Mars. In \xe2\x80\x9cParable of the Sower,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler describes Mars \xe2\x80\x94 which becomes a refuge for people escaping a dying Earth \xe2\x80\x94 as \xe2\x80\x9ccold, empty, almost airless, dead. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s heaven in a way.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2021, NASA gave a name to the Mars landing site for the Perseverance rover: the Octavia E. Butler Landing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that her works are as relevant today \xe2\x80\x94 if not more so \xe2\x80\x94 than when they were originally written and published is a testament to her vision, genius and timelessness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kathryn Stack Morgan, a scientist on the Perseverance project. In 2004, at Black to the Future, a science fiction festival in Seattle, Butler stood before an enthusiastic gathering of Black cross-disciplinary artists and spoke about her early years attempting to connect with other Black science fiction enthusiasts. At her first convention in 1970, she said, there was only one other Black person there. As years passed, she would survey convention crowds and count a few more faces, but \xe2\x80\x9cI was either the only Black person or one of two or three,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She would interact with Black audiences at academic conferences: writers and library groups who read \xe2\x80\x9cSF\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 her term of choice \xe2\x80\x94 for fun. Still, she recalled, \xe2\x80\x9ceven people who said they would like to write it \xe2\x80\xa6 they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we did that. Well, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, we pretty much didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d More than \xe2\x80\x9ctopics\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthemes,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler confronted pressing concerns and vexations humans found themselves in \xe2\x80\x94 the violence and suffering they inflicted on others and often on themselves. As a writer, Butler wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in checking boxes. She was looking past what we could see, gathering the questions and casting about for the necessary tools that might help to create a better future \xe2\x80\x94 to encourage people to be critical thinkers and active agents in their own destinies. She often had to defend her choices. She was persistently asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good is science fiction to Black people?\xe2\x80\x9d To which she would typically reply: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat good is any form of literature to Black people? What good is thinking about the future, warning, pointing the way? What good is examining the possible effects of science or social organization or political movements?\xe2\x80\x9d Fiction was more than \xe2\x80\x9cstories,\xe2\x80\x9d she felt. It was a way to acquire a new set of eyes \xe2\x80\x94 to effect change. She\xe2\x80\x99d seen it in her own life. \xe2\x80\x9cOctavia destroyed the sources of her own comfort without hesitation,\xe2\x80\x9d Nisi Shawl, an author and student of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s, wrote in the introduction to the 2021 Library of America edition of Butler\xe2\x80\x99s collected works. What Butler passed down to the following generations of writers, Shawl said, is the permission to do the same. \xe2\x80\x9cStrong emotions, she counseled me, are the best basis for stories,\xe2\x80\x9d Shawl wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you fear? What do you loathe? What would you give anything to rescue and protect and preserve for eternity? Write about that.\xe2\x80\x9d Butler\xe2\x80\x99s effect was indelible: Just being in the room, on a stage, behind a lectern, her very presence forced this consideration, pushing a more inclusive conversation. Her point of view was one not traditionally found in science fiction and, simply by writing, she demanded a larger world. Like the pomegranate trees whose life cycles she once studied in her native Pasadena, her vision has proved enduring and fruitful. She is remembered as serious and funny, relentless and disciplined, in her novels and her personal journals. For someone who only lived to 58, she gave so much, in her work and in her life \xe2\x80\x94 sowing seeds. When asked once where she felt her place was in the world, Butler replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI think my place is wherever I happen to be standing.\xe2\x80\x9d She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in writing \xe2\x80\x9cheroes.\xe2\x80\x9d She was interested in finding ways that imperfect humans might learn to secure a future beyond what they see. While scrolling down, the point of view also pans down, moving from the tops of the leaves of a pomegranate tree to the base of its trunk and the surrounding flowers and plants on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t write about heroes,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler once said. \xe2\x80\x9cI write about people who survive and sometimes prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d Lynell George is a Los Angeles-based journalist, essayist and author.

Let Us Count the Ways. DEEPLINKS BLOG By Jillian C. York and Corynne McSherryApril 29, 2019 Content Moderation is Broken. Let Us Count the Ways. Share It Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Copy link Social media platforms regularly engage in \xe2\x80\x9ccontent moderation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the depublication, downranking, and sometimes outright censorship of information and/or user accounts from social media and other digital platforms, usually based on an alleged violation of a platform\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity standards\xe2\x80\x9d policy. In recent years, this practice has become a matter of intense public interest. Not coincidentally, thanks to growing pressure from governments and some segments of the public to restrict various types of speech, it has also become more pervasive and aggressive, as companies struggle to self-regulate in the hope of avoiding legal mandates. Many of us view content moderation as a given, an integral component of modern social media. But the specific contours of the system were hardly foregone conclusions. In the early days of social media, decisions about what to allow and what not to were often made by small teams or even individuals, and often on the fly. And those decisions continue to shape our social media experience today. Roz Bowden\xe2\x80\x94who spoke about her experience at UCLA\xe2\x80\x99s All Things in Moderation conference in 2017\xe2\x80\x94ran the graveyard shift at MySpace from 2005 to 2008, training content moderators and devising rules as they went along. Last year, Bowden told the BBC: We had to come up with the rules. Watching porn and asking whether wearing a tiny spaghetti-strap bikini was nudity? Asking how much sex is too much sex for MySpace? Making up the rules as we went along. Should we allow someone to cut someone's head off in a video? No, but what if it is a cartoon? Is it OK for Tom and Jerry to do it? Similarly, in the early days of Google, then-deputy general counsel Nicole Wong was internally known as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Decider\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of the tough calls she and her team had to make about controversial speech and other expression. In a 2008 New York Times profile of Wong and Google\xe2\x80\x99s policy team, Jeffrey Rosen wrote that as a result of Google\xe2\x80\x99s market share and moderation model, \xe2\x80\x9cWong and her colleagues arguably have more influence over the contours of online expression than anyone else on the planet.\xe2\x80\x9d Built piecemeal over the years by a number of different actors passing through Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s revolving doors, content moderation was never meant to operate at the scale of billions of users. The engineers who designed the platforms we use on a daily basis failed to imagine that one day they would be used by activists to spread word of an uprising...or by state actors to call for genocide. And as pressure from lawmakers and the public to restrict various types of speech\xe2\x80\x94from terrorism to fake news\xe2\x80\x94grows, companies are desperately looking for ways to moderate content at scale. They won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed\xe2\x80\x94at least if they care about protecting online expression even half as much as they care about their bottom line. The Content Moderation System Is Fundamentally Broken. Let Us Count the Ways: 1. Content Moderation Is a Dangerous Job\xe2\x80\x94But We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Look to Robots to Do It Instead As a practice, content moderation relies on people in far-flung (and almost always economically less well-off) locales to cleanse our online spaces of the worst that humanity has to offer so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to see it. Most major platforms outsourcing the work to companies abroad, where some workers are reportedly paid as little as $6 a day and others report traumatic working conditions. Over the past few years, researchers such as EFF Pioneer Award winner Sarah T. Roberts have exposed just how harmful a job it can be to workers. Companies have also tried replacing human moderators with AI, thereby solving at least one problem (the psychological impact that comes from viewing gory images all day), but potentially replacing it with another: an even more secretive process in which false positives may never see the light of day. 2. Content Moderation Is Inconsistent and Confusing For starters, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about resources. Companies like Facebook and YouTube expend significant resources on content moderation, employing thousands of workers and utilizing sophisticated automation tools to flag or remove undesirable content. But one thing is abundantly clear: The resources allocated to content moderation aren\xe2\x80\x99t distributed evenly. Policing copyright is a top priority, and because automation can detect nipples better than it can recognize hate speech, users often complain that more attention is given to policing women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies than to speech that might actually be harmful. But the system of moderation is also inherently inconsistent. Because it relies largely on community policing\xe2\x80\x94that is, on people reporting other people for real or perceived violations of community standards\xe2\x80\x94some users are bound to be more heavily impacted than others. A person with a public profile and a lot of followers is mathematically more likely to be reported than a less popular user. And when a public figure is removed by one company, it can create a domino effect whereby other companies follow their lead. Problematically, companies\xe2\x80\x99 community standards also often feature exceptions for public figures: That\xe2\x80\x99s why the president of the United States can tweet hateful things with impunity, but an ordinary user can\xe2\x80\x99t. While there\xe2\x80\x99s some sense to such policies\xe2\x80\x94people should know what their politicians are saying\xe2\x80\x94certain speech obviously carries more weight when spoken by someone in a position of authority. Finally, when public pressure forces companies to react quickly to new \xe2\x80\x9cthreats,\xe2\x80\x9d they tend to overreact. For example, after the passing of FOSTA\xe2\x80\x94a law purportedly designed to stop sex trafficking but which, as a result of sweepingly broad language, has resulted in confusion and overbroad censorship by companies\xe2\x80\x94Facebook implemented a policy on sexual solicitation that was essentially a honeypot for trolls. In responding to ongoing violence in Myanmar, the company created an internal manual that contained elements of misinformation. And it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that some actors have greater ability to influence companies than others: A call from Congress or the European Parliament carries a lot more weight in Silicon Valley than one that originates from a country in Africa or Asia. By reacting to the media, governments, or other powerful actors, companies reinforce the power that such groups already have. 3. Content Moderation Decisions Can Cause Real-World Harms to Users as Well as Workers Companies\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to moderate what they deem undesirable content has all too often had a disproportionate effect on already-marginalized groups. Take, for example, the attempt by companies to eradicate homophobic and transphobic speech. While that sounds like a worthy goal, these policies have resulted in LGBTQ users being censored for engaging in counterspeech or for using reclaimed terms like \xe2\x80\x9cdyke\xe2\x80\x9d. Similarly, Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to remove hate speech have impacted individuals who have tried to use the platform to call out racism by sharing the content of hateful messages they\xe2\x80\x99ve received. As an article in the Washington Post explained, \xe2\x80\x9cCompounding their pain, Facebook will often go from censoring posts to locking users out of their accounts for 24 hours or more, without explanation \xe2\x80\x94 a punishment known among activists as \xe2\x80\x98Facebook jail.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Content moderation can also pose harms to business. Small and large businesses alike increasingly rely on social media advertising, but strict content rules disproportionately impact certain types of businesses. Facebook bans ads that it deems \xe2\x80\x9coverly suggestive or sexually provocative\xe2\x80\x9d, a practice that has had a chilling effect on women\xe2\x80\x99s health startups, bra companies, a book whose title contains the word \xe2\x80\x9cuterus\xe2\x80\x9d, and even the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unwanted Pregnancy. 4. Appeals Are Broken, and Transparency Is Minimal For many years, users who wished to appeal a moderation decision had no feasible path for doing so...unless of course they had access to someone at a company. As a result, public figures and others with access to digital rights groups or the media were able to get their content reinstated, while others were left in the dark. In recent years, some companies have made great strides in improving due process: Facebook, for example, expanded its appeals process last year. Still, users of various platforms complain that appeals lack result or go unanswered, and the introduction of more subtle enforcement mechanisms by some companies has meant that some moderation decisions are without a means of appeal. Last year, we joined several organizations and academics in creating the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation, a set of minimum standards that companies should implement to ensure that their users have access to due process and receive notification when their content is restricted, and to provide transparency to the public about what expression is being restricted and how. In the current system of content moderation, these are necessary measures that every company must take. But they are just a start. No More Magical Thinking We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look to Silicon Valley, or anyone else, to be international speech police for practical as much as political reasons. Content moderation is extremely difficult to get right, and at the scale at which some companies are operating, it may be impossible. As with any system of censorship, mistakes are inevitable. \xc2\xa0As companies increasingly use artificial intelligence to flag or moderate content\xe2\x80\x94another form of harm reduction, as it protects workers\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re inevitably going to see more errors. And although the ability to appeal is an important measure of harm reduction, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an adequate remedy. Advocates, companies, policymakers, and users have a choice: try to prop up and reinforce a broken system\xe2\x80\x94or remake it. If we choose the latter, which we should, here are some preliminary recommendations: Censorship must be rare and well-justified, particularly by tech giants. At a minimum, that means (1) Before banning a category of speech, policymakers and companies must explain what makes that category so exceptional, and the rules to define its boundaries must be clear and predictable. Any restrictions on speech should be both necessary and proportionate. Emergency takedowns, such as those that followed the recent attack in New Zealand, must be well-defined and reserved for true emergencies. And (2) when content is flagged as violating community standards, absent exigent circumstances companies must notify the user and give them an opportunity to appeal before the content is taken down. If they choose to appeal, the content should stay up until the question is resolved. But (3) smaller platforms dedicated to serving specific communities may want to take a more aggressive approach. That\xe2\x80\x99s fine, as long as Internet users have a range of meaningful options with which to engage. Consistency. Companies should align their policies with human rights norms. In a paper published last year, David Kaye\xe2\x80\x94the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression\xe2\x80\x94recommends that companies adopt policies that allow users to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop opinions, express themselves freely and access information of all kinds in a manner consistent with human rights law.\xe2\x80\x9d We agree, and we\xe2\x80\x99re joined in that opinion by a growing coalition of civil liberties and human rights organizations. Tools. Not everyone will be happy with every type of content, so users should be provided with more individualized tools to have control over what they see. For example, rather than banning consensual adult nudity outright, a platform could allow users to turn on or off the option to see it in their settings. Users could also have the option to share their settings with their community to apply to their own feeds. Evidence-based policymaking. Policymakers should tread carefully when operating without facts, and not fall victim to political pressure. For example, while we know that disinformation spreads rapidly on social media, many of the policies created by companies in the wake of pressure appear to have had little effect. Companies should work with researchers and experts to respond more appropriately to issues. Recognizing that something needs to be done is easy. Looking to AI to help do that thing is also easy. Actually doing content moderation well is very, very difficult, and you should be suspicious of any claim to the contrary.

Download PDF Download PDF Much of modern life depends on data stored and sold by private companies.Credit: Nikada/Getty Data Cartels: The Companies That Control and Monopolize Our Information Sarah Lamdan Stanford Univ. Press (2022)Information-technology platforms are ubiquitous in contemporary life. From friendships and genealogy to civic engagement, commercial transactions and charitable works, people rely on networked technologies that enable dialogue, authentication, payment and more. It is difficult to remember our daily lives before smartphones; those who have never known otherwise find those days impossible to imagine.Sarah Lamdan\xe2\x80\x99s Data Cartels is the latest in the genre of books that critically analyses such platforms, identifies bias, inequities and resultant harms, and asks why these for-profit companies are allowed to operate as they do. Lamdan focuses her attention on information and data brokers. These are relatively unknown, unlike social-media and search-engine companies (the respective targets of the 2018 books Antisocial Media by Siva Vaidhyanathan and Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble).Lamdan, a law scholar and librarian, concentrates particularly on RELX and Thomson Reuters, with some ancillary attention to Bloomberg and other commercial publishers. She unpacks their activities in unrelenting detail, examining their products and services across the arenas of data brokering, academic research, legal information, financial data and the news. Lamdan argues that these \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly legal\xe2\x80\x9d activities harm individuals and society, and erode democracy. Everyone should decide how their digital data are used \xe2\x80\x94 not just tech companies That this is a story of legal and regulatory failure is clear from the first, and evidenced throughout. The US government\xe2\x80\x99s documented divestment from public media brings into particularly sharp relief how current practices differ from those of the previous century, which regulated radio and television. These days, for example, only around 1% of media organization NPR\xe2\x80\x99s operating funds are contributed directly by the federal government. Congress has failed to enact laws that would constrain companies\xe2\x80\x99 data practices, and the courts have repeatedly weakened protections. Individuals have been left to fend for themselves. Even when they can document mistreatment, there is limited accountability for firms. Data brokers have successfully asserted a free-speech defence in the face of legal action seeking redress for the dissemination of inaccurate information.Lamdan\xe2\x80\x99s solution is a legal and regulatory regime that treats information and data as public resources and that provides public digital infrastructures. In her vision of a functional information ecosystem, private companies would still operate, but public infrastructure would deliver essential information without the sacrifice of personal privacy. This kind of library-like public digital infrastructure would require considerable resources. Lamdan does not offer any cost estimates. But extrapolating from the more than $470-million annual budget of the US National Library of Medicine, which provides fairly robust public access to health information, it is quickly apparent that the price tag would be multiple billions.The US track record with legal and financial information is, however, abysmal. Currently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the government provides information to the public, it does so with outdated, insufficient online tools and platforms\xe2\x80\x9d, Lamdan writes. These pale in comparison to paywalled corporate services. Any researcher using the government platforms PACER or EDGAR to find court records or financial data, respectively, will be frustrated with their limited information search, retrieval and management tools. As she notes, federal, state and local governments comprise a substantial customer base for many of the data brokers\xe2\x80\x99 services.Incremental reformUnfortunately, as Lamdan observes, the kind of comprehensive and coordinated legal and regulatory reform that would be required to tackle the problems she has laid out \xe2\x80\x94 addressing copyright complexities, re-establishing previously strong antitrust doctrines and closing loopholes in constitutional law \xe2\x80\x94 is unlikely. As such, she also identifies a number of incremental changes that would be useful. These include treating data brokers as information fiduciaries and \xe2\x80\x94 when governments contract for their services \xe2\x80\x94 as state actors bound by constitutional obligations.The book is replete with observations about how things should be and ideas for what the government could do. But the reader is left wondering why so many bills are introduced but not passed, and so many petitions for investigations filed but not acted on. If multiple attempts have failed, what are the barriers to success and what would it take to overcome them? Little attention is paid to these questions. Scientists use big data to sway elections and predict riots \xe2\x80\x94 welcome to the 1960s One also wonders why the discussion is almost entirely US-centric. RELX, based in London, and Thomson Reuters, headquartered in Toronto, Canada, are global companies used by researchers around the world. RELX\xe2\x80\x99s information-retrieval system LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters\xe2\x80\x99s research service Westlaw publish laws and related legal documents from many countries. Lamdan mentions in passing that European antitrust legislation focuses on fairness, whereas US laws concentrate on preventing economic harm to consumers. However, there is no vision of how the United States might pursue multilateral action or what might be the role of international organizations in responding to the problems outlined in the book. Is it even possible for the United States to act on its own?A broader look beyond governmental solutions would have been welcome, too. In addition to the international Free Access to Law Movement, which Lamdan highlights, there are organizations pursuing guidelines and standards (such as the US National Information Standards Organization\xe2\x80\x99s Consensus Principles on Users\xe2\x80\x99 Digital Privacy in Library, Publisher, and Software-Provider Systems) and cross-industry collaborations (one is the Vendor & Library Community of Practice, sponsored by the Intellectual Freedom Committee of the American Library Association). Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask if artificial intelligence is good or fair, ask how it shifts power The Institute of Museum and Library Services has awarded numerous grants on this topic. These include support for a project called Library Values & Privacy in the US National Digital Strategies: Field Guides, Convenings, and Conversations, and for a national forum on web privacy and analytics. There are enough library-led initiatives for the 2022 Electronic Resources and Libraries conference to have featured half a dozen in its keynote panel, including my own Licensing Privacy Project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in New York City. Philanthropic efforts such as Research4Life and INASP \xe2\x80\x94 both of which help researchers in low- and middle-income countries to access scholarly literature \xe2\x80\x94 as well as emerging shareholder and student activism, should not be overlooked.Having been involved in efforts to raise awareness of the impacts of data brokers over the past decade, I appreciate Lamdan\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful stance that it is not too late to reverse course and create a better world. Her rhetoric is powerful, her writing colourful and her critique vigorous. For those unfamiliar with the vast literature on challenges in the data and information arenas, this book is a useful compilation. Unfortunately, although Lamdan\xe2\x80\x99s vision of what could and should be might inspire, her call to action falls short of offering a clear path forward.

I will also demonstrate the design patterns with working Proof of Concept deployments that you can use as a starting point.Follow up posts: \xe2\x80\x93 Part 2 Setting up the Insecure Deployment\xe2\x80\x93 Part 3 The Security Service Layer Pattern\xe2\x80\x93 Part 4 The Security Sidecar Pattern\xe2\x80\x93 Part 5 The Service Mesh Sidecar-on-Sidecar Pattern There are many tutorials on microservice security and how to secure your Kubernetes clusters and they include many of the following topics: Checking for common cluster configuration errorsConfiguring encryption for cluster componentsConfiguring access controls to the cluster componentsUsing trusted container image repositoriesChecking for common security issues in code during buildControlling container privilegeEncrypting inter-microservice traffic These are worthy topics and they encompass many of the issues that are relevant to securing modern microservice architectures. But there are a couple of important items that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to emphasize: Controlling East/West traffic (layers 3 and 4) between Pods within the Kubernetes cluster (aka micro-segmentation)Deep inspection of the application traffic (layers 5, 6, and 7) between Pods within the Kubernetes cluster (aka IPS or WAF) These are concepts that have been around for a while in the traditional on-premises and virtualized data center world. Long ago it was recognized that it was no longer adequate to create a hard, crusty edge and leave a soft, gooey interior for attackers to exploit. The attack surface area can include vulnerabilities buried deep inside the application architecture that can be exploited. These include well-known OWASP top 10 web application attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), API attacks, and more. Let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss some microservice security patterns that can help. Kubernetes Application Security Patterns There are three fairly intuitive design patterns that I will be describing: Security Service Layer PatternSecurity Sidecar PatternService Mesh Security Plugin Pattern I\xe2\x80\x99ll be using the following simple Kubernetes deployment to show how we can layer micro-segmentation and application inspection within the cluster to provide better microservice security. Figure 1: Simple Simulated Microservice Deployment In this microservice architecture we see three simulated services: Public Web interface serviceInternal Authentication serviceInternal Database service I\xe2\x80\x99m using my microservice traffic and attack generation simulator called microsim to provide a realistic environment with a majority of \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 JSON/HTTP traffic between services with occasional SQL Injection attack traffic from the WWW service to the internal Auth and DB services. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s get into the different design patterns. Security Service Layer Pattern The Security Service Layer Pattern is probably the simplest to understand, since it is analogous to how micro-segmentation and deep inspection are deployed in traditional environments. Figure 2: Security Service Layer Pattern In this design pattern we see the insertion of a security layer in front of each microservice. In this case we are using the official OWASP modsecurity-crs container on Docker Hub. This container provides WAF functionality with the OWASP Core Rule Set and will detect attacks over HTTP, including the simulated SQL Injection attack traffic between microservices. Layer 3 and 4 micro-segmentation is implemented via a network provider that supports Network Policy. Some of the pros and cons of this design include: Pros: Simple to understandAllows scaling of the security tiers independent of the microservices they are protectingTreats application security as a microserviceNo need to change microservice ports Cons: Creates additional services in the clusterAdds traffic flow complexityRequires more micro-segmentation rules Security Sidecar Pattern The Security Sidecar Pattern takes the concept of the Security Service Layer Pattern and collapses the additional services into the microservice Pods.\xc2\xa0 Sidecar proxy containers, such as modsecurity, can be explicitly configured as part of the Deployment spec or can be injected into the Pods via MutatingWebhook. Figure 3: Security Sidecar Pattern In this design pattern we see the insertion of a security proxy container within each Pod, so both the security proxy and application containers are running in the same Pod. In this case we are also using the official OWASP modsecurity-crs container on Docker Hub. Layer 3 and 4 micro-segmentation is implemented via a network provider that supports Network Policy. Some of the pros and cons of this design include: Pros: Simple to understandUnifies the scaling of the security and application microservicesThe security proxy can be automatically injected into the PodWorks with an existing Service Mesh using the Sidecar on Sidecar patternRequires fewer micro-segmentation rules Cons: Requires the Security container and Application container to run on different TCP ports within the PodMay result in over-provisioning of the security layer resources Service Mesh Security Plugin Pattern The Service Mesh Security Plugin Pattern takes the concept of the Security Sidecar Pattern but implements the security functionality as a plugin to the Service Mesh\xe2\x80\x99s data plane sidecar container (e.g. Envoy in an Istio Service Mesh). Figure 4: Service Mesh Security Plugin Pattern In this design pattern we see the insertion of a service mesh data plane container (e.g. Envoy) within each Pod, so both the Service Mesh proxy and application containers are running in the same Pod. In this case the application layer inspection is handled through a modsecurity plugin for Envoy. Layer 3 and 4 micro-segmentation is implemented via the Service Mesh policy. Some of the pros and cons of this design include: Pros: More cleanly extends security into an existing Service MeshUnifies the scaling of the security and application microservicesThe Service Mesh proxy can be automatically injected into the PodMicro-segmentation rules can be implemented via Service Mesh policyService Mesh enables many advanced application delivery features Cons: Service Mesh deployments are more complexMay result in over-provisioning of the security layer resources Secure Microservice POC Deployments In my opinion, the Security Sidecar Pattern is the most convenient for small projects, but using a Service Mesh is probably a better idea for larger, more complex architectures. In some cases a hybrid approach will make more sense. Leave a reply if you know of any other designs you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the field! Stay tuned for future posts where I will demonstrate simple proof of concept implementations of these security design patterns. Next in the series: Part 2 Like this:Like Loading...

This photo simulates how this system works; the \xe2\x80\x9cblood\xe2\x80\x9d shown here is not real. Mark Stone/University of Washington bloodsmartphoneshealthcaremedical devicesmedical technologyThe phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a single drop of blood\xe2\x80\x9d is full of both promise and peril for researchers trying to integrate clinical-quality medical testing technology with consumer devices like smartphones. While university researchers and commercial startups worldwide continue to introduce innovative new consumer-friendly takes on tests that have resided in laboratories for decades, the collective memory of the fraud perpetrated by those behind Theranos\xe2\x80\x99s discredited blood-testing platform is still pervasive.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you claiming from a single drop of blood?\xe2\x80\x9d says Shyamnath Gollakota, director of the mobile intelligence lab at the University of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering. Gollakota and colleagues have developed a proof-of-concept test that is able to analyze how quickly a person\xe2\x80\x99s blood clots using a single drop of blood by utilizing a smartphone\xe2\x80\x99s camera, haptic motor, a small attached cup, and a floating piece of copper about the size of a ballpoint pen\xe2\x80\x99s writing tip.To activate the system, the user adds a drop of blood from a finger prick to a small cup attached to a bracket that fits over the phone. Then the phone\xe2\x80\x99s motor shakes the cup while the camera monitors the movement of the copper particle, which slows down and eventually stops as the clot forms. To calculate the time it takes the blood to clot, the phone collects two time stamps. The first is when the user inserts the blood, and second is when the particle stops moving. The technology performed is in line with commercial coagulation tests in the original study (published in Nature Communications) in a medical facility; Gollakota\xe2\x80\x99s team is now studying how it works in at-home environments.If the technology ever enters the commercial realm, those with conditions such as atrial fibrillation or who have mechanical heart valves might be able to test their coagulation times quickly and simply themselves instead of making frequent trips to doctors\xe2\x80\x99 offices or going without testing at all\xe2\x80\x94they would have to visit a doctor only when their home tests are out of range. Gollakota is careful not to claim the technology can do too much, but he is also dedicated to making its potentially lifesaving capabilities available to anyone with a smartphone.Blood clot testing using smartphoneswww.youtube.com\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not trying to say we can do miracles from a single drop of blood, but we are trying to say the devices that exist in hospitals to test for this haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed much for 20 or 30 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Gollakota said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut smartphones have been changing a lot. They have vibration motors, they have a camera, and these sensors exist on almost any smartphone.\xe2\x80\x9dRon Paulus, executive in residence at venture capital firm General Catalyst, said the Gollakota team\xe2\x80\x99s technology hews to a trio of ongoing trends he sees with smartphones in health care. The first is the ability to interact with current lab infrastructure for things like ordering and scheduling tests and receiving results directly instead of relying on a doctor as middleman. The second trend is using the phone in the field as a power source for a separate plug-in or bridge to a wireless module with the analyzing intelligence built into that. The third trend is using the phone as both a power source and an analyzing platform.There is no shortage of devices that inhabit the second category in Paulus\xe2\x80\x99s triumvirate; one example he cited was a dongle that plugged into a phone\xe2\x80\x99s headphone jack and performed tests for HIV and syphilis, returning results in 15 minutes, but the project\xe2\x80\x99s senior author, Columbia University vice provost and professor of biomedical engineering Samuel Sia, said it did not advance to commercialization.Another similar device is being developed by Sudbury, Ontario\xe2\x80\x93based Verv Technologies, which is perfecting a platform that uses a drop of blood from a finger prick, a disposable test cartridge, a Bluetooth-enabled analyzer, and a connected smartphone app that will give the user results in 15 minutes. The company recently received C$3.8 million seed funding from Crumlin, Northern Ireland\xe2\x80\x93based Randox Laboratories, and a C$314,000 grant with McMaster University from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; the grant will allow the McMaster research team to validate and derisk the technologies, according to Canadian Healthcare Technology.Paulus said consumer-ready smartphone-enabled tests are promising but not ready for mass market adoption yet.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still not there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can\xe2\x80\x99t go through an eight-step process that requires any kind of technology expertise. It has to be made so any normal, regular person can just do it and can\xe2\x80\x99t really make an error, and it has to be a reliable test. But there is no reason why in three to seven years, people should have to go out for a routine test, the kind of things people go to urgent care for. There is going to be a relentless push into this democratization.\xe2\x80\x9dIronically, both Paulus and Gollakota think the widespread at-home testing precipitated by the COVID pandemic made the idea of user tests requiring swabbing and dipping indicators and reading results commonplace to a large audience while developers perfect more streamlined devices.\xe2\x80\x9cWith COVID tests there were a lot of things we ended up doing ourselves and people are used to it in the home scenario now,\xe2\x80\x9d Gollakota said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s completely far-fetched to expect people to be able to do testing themselves with multipart tests. But I also think the idea of going forward is to roll the whole thing into one simple attachment.\xe2\x80\x9dFrom Your Site ArticlesIndieBio\xe2\x80\x99s First Class of Startups: Bioreactors, Blood Tests, and DIY Genetic Engineering \xe2\x80\xbaResearchers Are Getting Close to a Here-and-Now COVID-19 Test \xe2\x80\xba$34 Diagnostic Tool for STDs Plugs into Smartphone, Rivals $18,000 Lab Equipment \xe2\x80\xbaNew Smartphone Sensor Checks Your Blood Pressure \xe2\x80\xbabloodsmartphoneshealthcaremedical devicesmedical technology{""imageShortcodeIds"":[]}Greg GothThe Conversation (0)TopicEnergyTypeTransportationAnalysisCareers The EV Transition Explained: Battery Challenges 5h6 min readComputingTopicTypeNews Ownership of AI-Generated Code Hotly Disputed 9h4 min readThe InstituteTopicArticleTypeCareers Why Your Organization Should Join the IEEE Standards Association 18 Nov 20222 min read Related Stories SensorsTopicTypeNewsTransportation Crowdsourcing Bridge Inspection Artificial IntelligenceTopicEnergyTypeRoboticsNews Robots and AI Could Optimize Lithium-Ion Batteries BiomedicalTopicTypeNews No More Invasive Surgery\xe2\x80\x94This Pacemaker Dissolves Instead BiomedicalTopicDecember 2022MagazineTypeFeature Are You Ready for Workplace Brain Scanning?

Neural sensors are now reliable and affordable enough to support commercial pilot projects that extract productivity-enhancing data from workers\xe2\x80\x99 brains. These projects aren\xe2\x80\x99t confined to specialized workplaces; they\xe2\x80\x99re also happening in offices, factories, farms, and airports. The companies and people behind these neurotech devices are certain that they will improve our lives. But there are serious questions about whether work should be organized around certain functions of the brain, rather than the person as a whole. To be clear, the kind of neurotech that\xe2\x80\x99s currently available is nowhere close to reading minds. Sensors detect electrical activity across different areas of the brain, and the patterns in that activity can be broadly correlated with different feelings or physiological responses, such as stress, focus, or a reaction to external stimuli. These data can be exploited to make workers more efficient\xe2\x80\x94and, proponents of the technology say, to make them happier. Two of the most interesting innovators in this field are the Israel-based startup InnerEye, which aims to give workers superhuman abilities, and Emotiv, a Silicon Valley neurotech company that\xe2\x80\x99s bringing a brain-tracking wearable to office workers, including those working remotely.

By\xc2\xa0Daisy Hay Wednesday, November 16, 2022 Sentimental Conversation, by Quirijn van Brekelenkam, c. 1660. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Friedsam Collection, bequest of Michael Friedsam, 1931. As she looked to the future Mary Wollstonecraft made a determined effort to take control of her own story. She asked her lover Gilbert Imlay to return all her letters and he did so. She made the same request to Henry Fuseli but he refused. She began to work again, commissioning reviews for the Analytical Review on behalf of her publisher, Joseph Johnson. In a series of letters she bade Imlay farewell. She also took the correspondence she had written from Scandinavia and, with Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s support, turned it into a book. She called it Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and although in her revisions she blurred personal details and turned her gaze outward to the landscapes and customs of the countries she visited, she also left a carefully mediated version of personal unhappiness. Johnson published the book early in 1796, alongside a new edition of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. The reviews of Letters were admiring. \xe2\x80\x9cIf ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote William Godwin, \xe2\x80\x9cthis appears to me to be the book.\xe2\x80\x9d Godwin\xe2\x80\x99s diary for the summer of 1796 records a pattern of meetings as he and Wollstonecraft took tea together, met each other\xe2\x80\x99s friends, visited each other for supper after the day\xe2\x80\x99s work was done, and bumped into each other at the houses of others. The first letter between them dated from July and was from Wollstonecraft. She enclosed with it a gift of the last volume of Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s Julie; ou, La Nouvelle H\xc3\xa9lo\xc3\xafse, a novel famous for its revolutionary exploration of female emotional and sexual experience. She sent Julie, she explained, in order to encourage Godwin \xe2\x80\x9cnot to choose the easiest task, my perfections, but to dwell on your own feelings\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, give me a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view of your heart.\xe2\x80\x9d This instruction set the tone for a courtship correspondence that at times had the rapier wit of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Beatrice and Benedict and was at other points challenging, combative, affectionate, and melancholy. Wollstonecraft was thirty-six in 1796; Godwin forty. Wollstonecraft had confronted the possibility of being broken by her passions and had rebuilt her life in the face of pain. Godwin believed himself to be immune to the tumults and desires experienced by more susceptible men. Each knew the other to be a brilliant thinker and writer, with a public name and reputation. As they sparred their way to an understanding they treated each other as equals with independent intellects and unknown emotional hinterlands. When Wollstonecraft challenged Godwin to write of his feelings he poked fun at his own emotional reserve and her desire for self-expression, but he did not dissemble. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I write a love letter? May Lucifer fly away with me if I do! No, when I make love, it shall be with the eloquent tones of my voice, with dying accents, with speaking glances (through the glass of my spectacles), with all the witching of that irresistible, universal passion.\xe2\x80\x9d In late July it was Godwin\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be absent from London, and Wollstonecraft found herself missing him. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you mean to drink tea with me one of these days,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote at the beginning of August. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you find it in your heart to let me pass so many evenings alone.\xe2\x80\x9d She had written laments of abandonment before, to Imlay, but her mock chastisement of Godwin demonstrated new confidence in the strength of the connection they were forging. She sent him the manuscript of the self-revealing novel on which she was working. It was provisionally titled The Wrongs of Woman, and he read it with care. On August 15 he made a note in his diary: \xe2\x80\x9cchez moi.\xe2\x80\x9d The phrase, alongside its companion note, \xe2\x80\x9cchez elle,\xe2\x80\x9d was shorthand for the fact that Wollstonecraft and Godwin had spent the night together. It appeared in his diary with regularity thereafter. Sometimes he appended a gesture toward description. On August 21: \xe2\x80\x9cchez moi, toute.\xe2\x80\x9d At other points punctuation did the job of expressing the inexpressible: \xe2\x80\x9cchez elle, \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cchez moi, \xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d They were \xe2\x80\x9cchez elle\xe2\x80\x9d more often than \xe2\x80\x9cchez moi,\xe2\x80\x9d in recognition of the difficulty of leaving Fanny, Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s two-year-old daughter with Imlay, in the company of only her nursemaid. The day after their first night together there was a difficult exchange of letters. Both found it easier to communicate on paper than in person, and both acknowledged as much. Godwin had talked of roses growing in the path of every life and encouraged Wollstonecraft to embrace happiness: \xe2\x80\x9cI catch at them,\xe2\x80\x9d she responded, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only encounter the thorns.\xe2\x80\x9d At the outset of their correspondence she had asked him to describe his own feelings and, after years of rigorous self-containment, he reciprocated with an effusion of emotion she found alarming, even self-indulgent. \xe2\x80\x9cFull of your own feelings, little as I comprehend them, you forgot mine\xe2\x80\x94or do not understand my character.\xe2\x80\x9d The pain she had suffered, first over Fuseli and then over Imlay, made her cautious of becoming again the object of transient male passion. As August came to an end the tumults of high summer gave way to a more settled understanding. Their notes took on a patina of domesticity, as they exchanged work and made plans about where to meet, eat, and sleep. Godwin sent fond messages and tiny presents to Fanny, who took to calling him \xe2\x80\x9cMan.\xe2\x80\x9d When the weather turned stormy Wollstonecraft preferred to stay at home and dine with him by her own fireside, while Fanny slumbered nearby. Sometimes it was still easier to express emotions on paper. In September she reminded Godwin that her relationship with Imlay had produced a dependent child and required her to earn a living by her writing. Godwin had offered a critical response to work in draft, and she read his criticisms as a threat to her ability to keep body and soul together. In an uncharacteristically sharp attack on the two men whose friendship she most valued, she intimated that both he and Johnson had underestimated her talent and her worth. But her rediscovered confidence meant that such difficulties were surmountable. While she was out walking with Fanny the child demanded they pay a call on Godwin. \xe2\x80\x9cGo this way Mama, me wants to see Man.\xe2\x80\x9d Wollstonecraft related Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s plea to Godwin with pleasure at the unconventional family unit they were forming. Throughout the winter of 1796\xe2\x80\x9397 Wollstonecraft and Godwin continued in the pattern established that autumn. They exchanged frequent evening and nightly visits and letters to clear up misunderstandings; they moved forward with lives lived together but also apart. Both continued to dine with Johnson, sometimes on the same evening but often when the other was elsewhere. They were cautious about revealing their romance; distant acquaintances assumed that Wollstonecraft was married to Imlay, and she was wary of their censoriousness. She kept working, organizing Analytical reviews for Johnson and visiting Bedlam in the company of him and Godwin in order to undertake research for her new novel. She went to the theater with Godwin and endured a visit from her sister Everina. In early February she called on Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s old friend Dr. George Fordyce. There is some suggestion in her letters for this period that she and Godwin had been attempting to use a form of rhythm-based birth control. At the end of January, shortly before she called on Fordyce, she realized that this system had failed. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen are certainly great fools; but nature made them so. I have not time, or paper, else I could draw an inference not very illustrative of your chance-medley system.\xe2\x80\x9d The prospect of another pregnancy without the protection of marriage offered little comfort, but she faced its reality head-on. \xe2\x80\x9cI spare the moth-like opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Godwin. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is room enough in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Pregnancy introduced an uncertainty into Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s future that for a while she resisted. Sometimes she asked Godwin to take on some of her work for the Analytical. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a good boy write me a review of Vaurien.\xe2\x80\x9d She delighted in the blossoming affection between Godwin and Fanny, but she was an experienced parent and she warned him against overindulgence. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not give Fanny a cake today,\xe2\x80\x9d she reminded in him March. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid she stayed too long with you yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d At the end of March Johnson himself became a source of strain. He pressed her for work and was less prepared than usual to settle her family\xe2\x80\x99s debts. \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson is either half ruined by the present public circumstances, or grown strangely mean, at any rate he torments me.\xe2\x80\x9d The financial arrangements between Johnson and Wollstonecraft were labyrinthine in their complexity, and details of their transactions have not survived. He sustained her existence, but she never felt free of debt or obligation and, in the early stages of an unexpected pregnancy, the extent of her entanglements increased her sense of vulnerability. Six days after Wollstonecraft wrote of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s meanness Godwin made a note in his diary: \xe2\x80\x9cPanc.\xe2\x80\x9d The word signified his marriage to Wollstonecraft at St. Pancras Church on March 29, 1797. They married as a result of her pregnancy and because she knew too well the difficulties entailed in raising a child outside wedlock. The wedding revealed to casual observers that her marriage to Imlay had been a fiction. Although she moved with Fanny into Godwin\xe2\x80\x99s house in Somers Town after the wedding, she and Godwin agreed to maintain separate working spaces, and he accordingly rented a study in lodgings nearby. During the day they thus continued to correspond by letter. Godwin attempted to consolidate her debts, many of which she had incurred as a result of her entanglement with Imlay. She and Godwin continued to experience periods of misunderstanding and difficulty and they wrote frankly of the moments when they had failed or disappointed each other. In June Godwin set off on a tour of the Midlands, and during his absence the correspondence between them stretched out once more. His letters were full of new scenes and new people, interspersed with affectionate messages for Fanny and enquiries after their unborn baby, who they called William (both were convinced that the child would be a boy). To Wollstonecraft herself he sent messages of love and sympathy for the discomforts of pregnancy. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember at every moment all the accidents to which your condition subjects you, & wish I knew of some sympathy that could inform me from moment to moment, how you do, & how you feel.\xe2\x80\x9d He had promised Fanny to bring her a present from Wedgwood\xe2\x80\x99s factory at Etruria and on June 7 he sent a message that he had not forgotten his vow. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember William; but (most of all) take care of yourself. Tell Fanny, I am safely arrived in the land of mugs.\xe2\x80\x9d In Godwin\xe2\x80\x99s absence Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s attention turned inward. She was now six months pregnant and the physical experience of carrying a second child was at times all-encompassing. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite well the day after you left me,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote on June 6. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is past, and I am well and tranquil, excepting the disturbance produced by Master William\xe2\x80\x99s joy, who took it in his head to frisk a little at being informed of your remembrance. I begin to love this little creature, and to anticipate his birth as a fresh twist to a knot, which I do not wish to untie.\xe2\x80\x9d Godwin\xe2\x80\x99s journey home took longer than he had anticipated, and on June 19 she wrote crossly that she had sat up until midnight waiting for him to appear. After his return they resumed their pattern of dining out together and alone, but at the end of June Wollstonecraft confessed that she felt a prisoner of her changing body. On August 30, 1797, Wollstonecraft sent a note to Godwin to tell him she was in labor. The midwife had been sent for, and Wollstonecraft was confident of a speedy delivery. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt of seeing the animal today.\xe2\x80\x9d In the meantime, she was bored. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had a novel, or some book of sheer amusement, to excite curiosity, and while away the time\xe2\x80\x94have you anything of the kind?\xe2\x80\x9d The midwife arrived and was sure that the baby was on its way although \xe2\x80\x9cshe thinks I shall not immediately be freed from my load.\xe2\x80\x9d A short time later Wollstonecraft sent a third bulletin. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Blenkinsop tells me that I am in the most natural state, and can promise me a safe delivery\xe2\x80\x94but that I must have a little patience.\xe2\x80\x9d At this point her voice falls silent. Late in the evening of August 30 she gave birth to a baby girl. She had planned to present the child to Godwin herself, and in obedience to her instructions he waited in the parlor to be summoned to her bedroom. In the early hours of September 1 the summons came not from Wollstonecraft but from the midwife. The placenta was not delivered, and she was unable to extract it. Godwin sent for a doctor, who removed it in pieces. Wollstonecraft, even though she had now given birth twice, told Godwin that until the manual extraction of the placenta she had \xe2\x80\x9cnever known what bodily pain was before.\xe2\x80\x9d Godwin dismissed the emergency doctor and, at Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s request, sent for Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s friend George Fordyce. What Fordyce did not know was that, despite his assertions to the contrary, the doctor who removed the placenta had not succeeded in extracting the organ complete. As a result of the retained placenta and the trauma of the attempted manual extraction, Wollstonecraft contracted septicemia. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s initial confidence in her strength gave way to anxiety; on September 2 a nurse arrived to take charge. On September 3 Fordyce called twice; in his diary Godwin recorded \xe2\x80\x9cshivering fits.\xe2\x80\x9d On September 4 puppies were brought to Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s room to draw off her excess breast milk, since her baby girl was being cared for elsewhere. A second doctor was summoned: another friend, Thomas Carlisle. He agreed with Fordyce that their only option was to ply Wollstonecraft with wine to dull her awareness and her pain. Old supporters of Godwin gathered in the parlor below, ready to take messages across London at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Wollstonecraft knew that she was dying. On September 8 Godwin recorded in his diary a \xe2\x80\x9csolemn communication.\xe2\x80\x9d A day later he asked for her guidance about how he should care for Fanny and the baby, who they called Mary. Wollstonecraft was slipping in and out of consciousness and was unable to issue instructions. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter having repeated this idea to her in a great variety of forms,\xe2\x80\x9d Godwin recalled, \xe2\x80\x9cshe at length said, with a significant tone of voice, \xe2\x80\x98I know what you are thinking of,\xe2\x80\x99 but added that she had nothing to communicate to me upon the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d She died on the morning of September 10. Godwin wrote the time and a series of dashes in his diary. \xe2\x80\x9c20 minutes before 8. \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93.\xe2\x80\x9d Within weeks of her death Godwin began work on a book he called Memoirs of the Author of \xe2\x80\x9cA Vindication of the Rights of Woman\xe2\x80\x9d. Johnson was his principal source of information for Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s life in London between 1788 and 1795. He also wrote letters to all those who he thought might have information about his wife\xe2\x80\x99s early years. He began dining regularly at Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s, seeking comfort in the company of a man who had been Wollstonecraft\xe2\x80\x99s friend. In late October, six weeks after her death, he attempted to describe how much he had lost. For forty years, he told his correspondent, he had been alone in the world. The brevity of his joy added to his agony. \xe2\x80\x9cI partook of a happiness, by so much more exquisite, as I had a short time before, had no conception of it, or scarcely admitted its possibility, & saw one bright ray that streaked my day of life, only to leave the remainder more gloomy, & (in the truest sense of the word hope) hopeless.\xe2\x80\x9d As he surveyed the future, it was Fanny and baby Mary who were his chief concern. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poor children! I am myself, madam, totally unfitted to educate them. The skepticism, which perhaps sometimes leads me right in matters of speculation, is torment to me when I would attempt to direct the infant mind. I am the most unfit person for this office; she was the best qualified in the world.

120,Leader as shock absorber (edbatista.com),https://www.edbatista.com/2022/10/leader-as-shock-absorber.html,17,"b'Leader as Shock Absorber (Ed Batista) Ed Batista About Resources Contact \xc2\xab The Balcony and the Dance Floor | Main | Emotional Speed Bumps \xc2\xbb Oct 27, 2022 Leader as Shock Absorber One of a leader\'s most important functions is serving as a shock absorber, soaking up forces generated by one part of the organization (or from outside the organization) and distributing them elsewhere, and doing so in such a way that the entire system operates more effectively. This is a simple metaphor, but it has some implications that are worth making explicit: A shock absorber cushions the blow--it doesn\'t prevent the flow of force. If a shock absorber tried to prevent force from flowing, it would A) collapse and then B) wreak havoc on the system. A useful shock absorber serves a dampening effect, diminishing a force\'s intensity or frequency before passing it along. But it doesn\'t try to stop force from being transmitted throughout the system. The controlled movement of force through a system is what makes the system useful. The equivalent for a leader is translating forces from within and beyond the organization into forms of energy that can be productively absorbed by the intended targets. A shock absorber pushes back--in both directions. An effective shock absorber doesn\'t just act as a conduit, passing force along to adjacent elements in the system. It also generates resistance, which increases in proportion to the force being applied. This resistance is tempered so it won\'t exceed pre-determined limits, and it\'s bi-directional--it flows up as well as down. The equivalent for a leader is knowing when and how to offer resistance, not only to colleagues and subordinates but also to superiors and external stakeholders. A shock absorber is, above all else, resilient. A well-designed shock absorber will last a long time over rough terrain, and not because it\'s tough, but because it\'s resilient. A resilient component deforms under pressure while retaining its internal consistency, later returning to its original form. Iron is tough, but it\'s not resilient--when it reaches its breaking point it shatters into pieces. The equivalent for a leader is acknowledging the stress of leadership, obtaining useful forms of support well before they\'re needed, and committing to self-care practices that foster high performance.

Check out our manifesto: Honest Security. Twitter Tumult Friday, 18 November 2022 If you had told me three weeks ago that Twitter, as a company, would today be embroiled in turmoil\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89perhaps outright existential crisis\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89over a company-wide email from Elon Musk centered around the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cextremely hardcore\xe2\x80\x9d, this is not the scenario I\xe2\x80\x99d have imagined. It\xe2\x80\x99s as though Musk has taken Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMove fast and break things\xe2\x80\x9d motto and reduced it to \xe2\x80\x9cBreak everything fast.\xe2\x80\x9d Last night, reports of mass resignations inside Twitter seemed so dire that Twitter itself seemed to be documenting its own demise, like HAL 9000 singing \xe2\x80\x9cDaisy\xe2\x80\x9d, ever more degenerately slurred, near the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I lost count of how many of the people I follow were seemingly posting what they expected, last night, to be their last-ever tweets. The New York Times: Hours before a Thursday deadline that Elon Musk gave Twitter employees to decide whether to stay or leave their jobs, the social media company appeared to be in disarray. Mr. Musk and his advisers held meetings with some Twitter workers whom they deemed \xe2\x80\x9ccritical\xe2\x80\x9d to stop them from leaving, four people with knowledge of the conversations said. He sent confusing messages about the company\xe2\x80\x99s remote work policy, appearing to soften his stance on not allowing people to work from home before warning their managers, according to those people and internal emails viewed by The New York Times. All the while, two people said, resignations started to roll in. By the deadline, 5 p.m. Eastern time, hundreds of Twitter employees appeared to have decided to depart with three months of severance pay, the people said. Twitter later announced via email that it would close \xe2\x80\x9cour office buildings\xe2\x80\x9d and disable employee badge access until Monday. Zo\xc3\xab Schiffer, today: Email from Elon to the engineering team: \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who can actually write software, please report to the 10th floor at 2pm today. Before doing so, please email me a bullet point summary of what your code commits have achieved in the past 6 months.\xe2\x80\x9d Elon Musk is also asking for up 10 screenshots of the \xe2\x80\x9cmost salient lines of code\xe2\x80\x9d from Twitter engineers. This latest edict is bananas in several ways, not the least of which is that the company claimed just 12 hours earlier that its offices would be closed today. As I quipped (on Twitter, which, as I publish this, is still seemingly fully operational), either (a) the offices aren\xe2\x80\x99t closed until next week; or (b) getting to the 10th floor is an interview puzzle to keep your job? But at a deeper level, the idea that counting lines of code or looking at \xe2\x80\x9cup to 10 screenshots\xe2\x80\x9d of code can give any effective measure of a programmer is absurdly wrong. Some of the most elite programmers I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known have an uncanny knack for reducing lines of code. Programmers working on security issues necessarily code with painstaking care. And, of course, there are dozens of essential roles at Twitter\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89some highly technical\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve \xe2\x80\x9ccode commits\xe2\x80\x9d at all. Alex Heath and Mia Sato, reporting for The Verge: Twitter had roughly 2,900 remaining employees before the deadline Thursday, thanks to Musk unceremoniously laying off about half of the 7,500-person workforce when he took over and the resignations that followed. Remaining and departing Twitter employees told The Verge that, given the scale of the resignations this week, they expect the platform to start breaking soon. One said that they\xe2\x80\x99ve watched \xe2\x80\x9clegendary engineers\xe2\x80\x9d and others they look up to leave one by one. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like all the people who made this place incredible are leaving,\xe2\x80\x9d the Twitter staffer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be extremely hard for Twitter to recover from here, no matter how hardcore the people who remain try to be.\xe2\x80\x9d Multiple \xe2\x80\x9ccritical\xe2\x80\x9d teams inside Twitter have now either completely or near-completely resigned, said other employees who requested anonymity to speak without Musk\xe2\x80\x99s permission. That includes Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s traffic and front end teams that route engineering requests to the correct backend services. The team that maintains Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s core system libraries that every engineer at the company uses is also gone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot run Twitter without this team,\xe2\x80\x9d a departing employee said. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that there have been mass resignations\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89on top of last week\xe2\x80\x99s mass layoff\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89in the face of Musk\xe2\x80\x99s fealty demand. Whether these resignations spell doom for the company remains to be seen. My apparently wrongheaded optimism for Twitter under Musk\xe2\x80\x99s leadership was rooted in the idea that while he might\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89and almost surely would\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89make mistakes with product decisions (including content moderation), product decisions can be reversed. Losing essential talent and destroying employee morale, not so much. This thoughtful, measured thread from departing Twitter engineer Peter Clowes sums it up: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave because I hate @elonmusk. I definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with many of his decisions or how they were carried out but I also understood and respected others. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know him and if someone tells me to hate a stranger I say \xe2\x80\x9cno thanks\xe2\x80\x9d. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave because of the 50% company wide layoff that missed me. We all knew a layoff was coming. Prior management would likely have cut too shallow at first and then had to do multiple rounds. I think that would have sucked regardless. I left because I no longer knew what I was staying for. Previously I was staying for the people, the vision, and of course the money (lets all be honest). All of those were radically changed or uncertain. [...] If I stayed I would have been on-call constantly with little support for an indeterminate amount of time on several additional complex systems I had no experience in. Maybe for the right vision I could have dug deep and done mind numbing work for awhile. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing\xe2\x80\xa6 There was no vision shared with us. No 5 year plan like at Tesla. Nothing more than what anyone can see on Twitter. It allegedly is coming for those who stayed but the ask was blind faith and required signing away the severance offer before seeing it.

124,On Company Size (world.hey.com),https://world.hey.com/jason/on-company-size-8095488d,16,"b""On company size Jason Fried November 19, 2022 On company size I have no idea how the the Musk-era Twitter saga will end up. That's a time will tell situation.And this isn't a post about Elon, his management style, decisions being made, talent drain, morale at the company, or the thousands of people who've been laid off or outright quit. There's plenty to be said there, and plenty of people are saying it \xe2\x80\x94 many on Twitter, no less.But I do want to comment, and counter, on one point.There's this anchoring notion that a company that had about 8000 or so people a few weeks ago must have close to that many \xe2\x80\x94 or even half that many \xe2\x80\x94 to run effectively. I don't believe what you had has anything to do with what you need.I know this from personal experience. I've run a company for 23 years that has been competing directly with massive companies for many of those years. And while all those companies think they need that many people to run their operations and support their business, I know you can do a whole lot with a whole lot less. And not just do, but do just as well \xe2\x80\x94 or better.Every company has different priorities of course, but let's examine a few things.With the information I was able to find online...Monday has about 1500 employees.Asana has about 1600 employees.Clickup has about 1000 employees.Slack has over 2500 employees.Smartsheet has over 3000 employees.These are some of our direct competitors. Each of these companies has somewhere between 100-150k paying customers. Give or take a few ten thousand. And thousands more free users too.Guess what? We do too. We're right in that ballpark as well. None of these companies, us included, have an order of magnitude more customers than the other. Of course none of this is apples-to-apples, as every company is different, but we're still talking fruit. This isn't apples-to-chickens. We all offer similar kinds of products that do similar-enough things for purpose of comparison. Revenues and profits may be different, but that's a matter of business model, not the number of people served, or the quality of service.And how many employees do we have at 37signals? Around 80 (which is the most we've ever had). And are they working ridiculous all-nighters or weekends to make up for the significantly smaller team? No \xe2\x80\x94 we all work about 40 hours a week.What's our uptime? Exceptional.How's our customer service? Friendly, quick, and thorough.How do our customers feel about our products? Here's what 1000 have to say about Basecamp, for example.Similar story for HEY. On top of that, we also maintain two previous versions of Basecamp, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack for thousands of customers who remain on earlier versions or older products.Building complex, large organizations is a choice, not a requirement. We chose differently. Other companies might as well.So it's absolutely possible to run a tight ship, deliver outstanding products, offer the highest level of customer service, and have exceptional uptime with a small, focused, high-quality crew working reasonable hours while living in a dozen different cities around the world.As for Twitter, I don't know what the right number is \xe2\x80\x94 and it's really not a number, it's a distribution. I mean, if you had 8000 people at Twitter, and they were all in sales, Twitter would be in trouble. So you obviously have to have the right people in the right places doing the right jobs, but thousands upon thousands is not a requirement simply because there were thousands upon thousands before.And I'm obviously not comparing the complexity of running a service like Twitter with Basecamp or HEY, but I do think it's very fair to compare Monday and Asana and Clickup and Slack (and others) to Basecamp and HEY. And we're able to service around the same number of customers, and actually generate more profit than all of them combined (since they're losing hundreds of millions annually, between them).Small is not less than.

126,Let's kill the universe (quimzy.github.io),https://quimzy.github.io/random/thoughts/2022/11/16/lets-kill-the-universe.html,15,"b""Let\xe2\x80\x99s kill the universe | What to think What to think About Let's kill the universe Nov 16, 2022 I spent the past two weeks continuously reading two short stories by Isaac Asimov: The last question and The last answer. Each time the existential dread grows more and i find myself hopelessly trying to figure a way out. I mean, as a 15 year old, reading about how entropy will ultimately kill the universe and that every effort we do to stop it only backfires at us doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to a good place mentally. And then with The last answer you learn about this \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d who created the universe and everything in it just to find more knowledge and using everyone to serve a purpose that won\xe2\x80\x99t benefit them, the rabbit hole gets even deeper. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to find a way to get noticed by this God and to win against nature. Well, it appears to be the same task after all. I was listening to Andrej Karpathy on Lex Fridman and he was talking about the universe\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and that our creator (whoever that is) may have created everything just to solve some sort of a puzzle. Maybe the puzzle is to escape the program, some sort of an advanced hacking test, a CTF? A competition between billions of species trying to get noticed by God? Whatever it is, how can we win? To escape any program you have to break one of its rules. Unfortuantly, the universe doens\xe2\x80\x99t work that way. You can\xe2\x80\x99t break any physical law, hence, no escape. An alternative way to do it is by stopping the program all at once. A well-known technique to do this is buffer overflow; you feed the system more input that it could handle so it breaks. In computer hacking, you can inject a malicious code with that buffer overflow to get access to the computer running the program. So, should we buffer overflow nature? The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that entropy, the amount of randomness and chaos in a closed system, always increases. This law -like any other law in the universe- is unbreakable, entropy could never be decreased. It could be increased tho. Many physicists believe that the universe will likely end by a never-ending process called, \xe2\x80\x9cThe heat death of the universe\xe2\x80\x9d, where entropy increases to a point where no energy has remained for particles to move and matter to form. It has been going since the big bang, nothing can stop it. So why not try our luck? Why not kill it faster? Theoretically, we just need to create a system that increases entropy really fast and the simulation just halts. Although, this type of weapon could be universally illegal if there was a universal government. It is not just a weapon of mass destruction, it\xe2\x80\x99s the WMD. Maybe whoever creates this system first will have control over every organism in the universe. Countless possibilities. This is the only way we could win against nature. And that win could be all we need to escape the simulation, to be noticed by God, to capture the flag. So\xe2\x80\xa6 Let's kill the universe Btw, happy birthday to me.

129,SQLite3's WASM/JS build now includes ES6 module (sqlite.org),https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/80e2da35d0,12,"b'SQLite Forum: ESM Compatible WASM package SQLite ForumESM Compatible WASM package Login \xe2\x98\xb0About Threads Post Subscribe SQLite Chronological Unformatted History ESM Compatible WASM package (1) By mlaw (tantaman) on 2022-11-03 16:00:57 [link] [source] The WASM modules for SQLite aren\'t the easiest to import and use. Mainly because they don\'t conform to ESM and secondarily because they can\'t find the wasm and opfs-proxy locations on their own. Myself and @schickling have hacked around this and created an ES module & npm package that users of sqlite can just import and use. Example: import sqliteWasm from ""sqlite-wasm-esm""; const sqlite = await sqliteWasm(); const db = new sqlite.oo1.DB("":memory:""); db.exec([ ""CREATE TABLE foo (a primary key, b);"", ""INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 2);"", ]); (full example: https://github.com/overtone-app/sqlite-wasm-esm/blob/main/packages/example/src/sqlite.ts) The package figures out where the .wasm bundle is as well as the opfs-proxy so the user doesn\'t have to deal with it. What we\'ve done is essentially a collection of ugly find & replaces against the sqlite3.js that you all provide. We update sqlite3.js to make use of import.meta.url for resolving paths as well as to make it esm compliant. Replacements made: https://github.com/overtone-app/sqlite-wasm-esm/blob/main/build/build.sh Any chance you all would either: (a) update the wasm artifacts to be esm compliant and make use of import.meta.url or (b) allow us to submit patches to the relevant source files (extern-post, extern-pre, post-js-footer, post-js-header)? (2) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-03 17:01:09 in reply to 1 [link] [source] The WASM modules for SQLite aren\'t the easiest to import and use. Mainly because they don\'t conform to ESM If you can tell us what ESM is, we can look into improving that. The builds are created by Emscripten, which is ""the"" WASM toolkit, and we\'re kind of at its mercy in terms of how it packages things. For better or worse, we\'re currently tied to Emscripten\'s way of doing things, an that is unlikely to change before mid next year at the earliest. and secondarily because they can\'t find the wasm and opfs-proxy locations on their own. See https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/gotchas.md for why that is. import sqliteWasm from ""sqlite-wasm-esm""; We haven\'t looked into ES6 modules at all because, frankly, they\'re simply not portable enough yet and are far too limiting in how they permit stuff to be loaded. e.g. Firefox cannot load ES6 modules from a Worker. What we\'ve done is essentially a collection of ugly find & replaces against the sqlite3.js that you all provide. See the ""gotchas"" link above for an easier (IMO) solution. i struggled for several days looking for a 100% transparent way for it to find the wasm file based on the js file, but discrepancies in how relative URIs are resolved in JS APIs, depending on how the JS file is loaded, make that literally impossible to do 100% transparently. We cannot tell clients ""you may only load this from the main thread"" or ""you may only load this from a worker constructor"" or ""you may only load this via importScripts()."" Each approach has its pros and cons, and we have features which work in Workers but no the UI thread, and vice versa. All three approaches have to be able to work. Any chance you all would either: (a) update the wasm artifacts to be esm compliant If you mean ES6 modules the answer is, for the time being, unequivocally no. ES6 modules are way down the list of things to investigate and explore, and a pending move back to Berlin is forcing me to be exceptionally choosy about what gets explored and improved for the time being. My schedule won\'t free up for full-time hacking again until, best case, March 2023. Until then, i\'m going to have to say ""no!"" more often than i\'d care to ;). That said: i\'ve tried to structure the main JS files (sqlite3-api-*.js) in such a way that we can easily repackage them for use with arbitrary WASM environments and near-arbitrary packaging schemes (like ES6 modules). Only practice will reveal whether that goal has truly been reached or not. and make use of import.meta.url No idea what that is :/ but i will look it up. sqlite has always been a C-centric project, and this foray into JS and WASM is new for us. There will be a learning curve for us and we currently only have one developer dedicated to these components (/me raises hand), so we will move slowly at times. You have my apologies for that, but there\'s no current workaround for it. or (b) allow us to submit patches to the relevant source files (extern-post, extern-pre, post-js-footer, post-js-header)? This project does not accept patches from non-members for reasons described in detail at: https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html Note that all of the files named pre/post-anything are Emscripten-specific. They\'re there in order to account for Emscripten-isms and, in some cases, replace Emscripten functionality when we can find a better way of doing the same thing and Emscripten provides a hook for us to do so (like the relative URI ""gotcha"" at the link above - we have to override certain Emscripten functionality to get that working at all). What we can do is use posted patches as a basis for implementing similar functionality, so please continue to post your improvements and we will certainly get around to investigating them. What i cannot currently promise, however, is a quick turnaround. Real Life has unpredictably collided at an unfortunate angle with the public beta phase for the JS/WASM pieces and that will slow me down considerably. (3) By mlaw (tantaman) on 2022-11-03 17:20:40 in reply to 2 [link] [source] Yeah ESM == ES6 Modules. In terms of portability, I wonder how many people still do JS development without a build tool (babeljs/vite/parcel/etc.) to iron out all the incompatible features. But yes, if you want to ensure nobody ever has to use a build tool to use your module then you\'ll need to preclude the use of ES6. We\'ll keep working on our wrapper as I think it creates a better developer experience for those either using modern JS build tools (and thus getting ES6 module support everywhere -- even workers) or environments (e.g., Deno) that support ES6 modules. i\'ve tried to structure the main JS files (sqlite3-api-*.js) in such a way that we can easily repackage them for use with arbitrary WASM environments and near-arbitrary packaging schemes (like ES6 modules) I\'ll look over these again to see if we can streamline how we are re-packaging things into ES6 modules. No idea what that [import.meta.url] is It\'s metadata about where the currently executing ES6 module lives. JS build tools are also aware of this property and re-write it when targeting environments that don\'t support ES6 modules. i\'m going to have to say ""no!"" more often than i\'d care to ;). np. I\'ve always been bad at saying ""no!"" and applaud you in holding the line. (4) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-03 18:20:14 in reply to 3 [link] [source] I wonder how many people still do JS development without a build tool (babeljs/vite/parcel/etc.) to iron out all the incompatible features. We don\'t use any JS build tools directly. We use the emsdk (Emscripten) to compile its module, but all of our own JS code is lovingly hand-written in Emacs and structured in such a way that we can eventually plug it in to arbitrary wasm environments. (We have built and loaded the library with other wasm toolchains, but they\'re missing certain C/WASM library-level support which we currently rely on.) It will be a cold day in That Really Hot Place before we start using any node.js-based tools for development. Folks are more than welcomed - even encouraged - to make any changes they need to fit it into their non-GNU-make-based build systems, but the odds that my cold, cold heart will ever warm up to any of the node.js-based tools are slim to none. Been there, done that, and don\'t care to return to it. But yes, if you want to ensure nobody ever has to use a build tool to use your module then you\'ll need to preclude the use of ES6. i knew that the request for es6 modules would come eventually, and i am most definitely not averse to exploring that option, but other priorities will, in all likelihood, push it back until early next year. That said: if you want to provide a how-to to re-packaging it to create an es6 module out of it, or (even better), show us how to add that support in such a way that em6 modules would automatically make use of it but conventional loading would still behave properly, we would be all for that. If we can pack it into a single deliverable, that would be fantastic, but a second option which produces an es6-only deliverable would be a welcomed second choice. BTW, you\'re welcome to contact me off-list about this if you prefer. If there\'s enough interest/participants specific to the JS/WASM bits, we may consider opening up the forum on the /wasm repo for those topics. We\'ve discussed that internally but have left it as an open point pending how much traffic those topics end up consuming on the forum. My current ability to commit time to es6 module support is directly tied to how much support i can get from someone like you who knows their way around them (my practical experience with them is literally zero, so without such support it\'s going to be a slow, uphill trip). With your help, perhaps we can burn through it quickly. Forgot to mention: https://github.com/overtone-app/sqlite-wasm-esm/blob/main/build/build.sh That is extremely fragile. The symbol names you\'re referring to can change in literally any given commit. Nothing the sqlite3.js bundle which is not attached to the sqlite3 namespace object is part of any stable interface and subject to any number of changes or removal at any time. Even the ostensibly public APIs are currently in ""public beta"" and subject to change, based (we hope) on feedback from folks who\'ve tried them. It\'s long been my experience that 3rd-party users often have the best feature/improvement suggestions. Currently the only 100% set-in-stone APIs are the direct exports of the C APIs. As we leave the public beta phase (perhaps 1-2 sqlite releases? We don\'t yet know) we will apply strong stability constraints on future API changes.

Trying the above patch (with the corrected s/imports/import/g) leads to the module failing to start with this error from Chrome: Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module We\'ll need to find a different approach to building for es6 modules which avoids that symbol in non-esm builds. That might mean breaking down the scripts into smaller parts and using esm-specific pieces for some parts. i\'ll mull that over. Maybe simply running it through a C pre-processor would suffice, with different defines for ems and conventional builds. Your current approach to sed\'ing the script is not maintainable long-term and i can\'t commit to trying to remember to not change any given line just to keep 3rd-party sed scripts working. (10) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-14 15:04:52 in reply to 6 [link] [source] Maybe simply running it through a C pre-processor would suffice, with different defines for esm and conventional builds. Follow-up: it turns out that running JS code through a C preprocessor, though ostensibly unproblematic, has quirks which make it untenable. That annoyance prompted me to dive down a rabbit hole to develop a suitable preprocessor which we can potentially use in the sqlite3 JS build process to create separate post-processed source files with ESM-compatible constructs, e.g. using the import keyword where appropriate. It\'s not yet been added to the JS build process, but we now have a suitable tool for the job should that route prove interesting or necessary. (11) By anonymous on 2022-11-14 16:14:55 in reply to 10 [link] [source] The documentation is confusing. This sentence seems to imply that there\'s always a ""."" at the start of the include path list: Regardless of the include path, a filename which matches a file without any path expansion is considered a better match. But that clashes with the previous sentence: The include search path is defined by passing one or more -Idirname flags to the app and if no such flags are provided, -I. is assumed. (7) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-03 22:49:21 in reply to 1 [link] [source] Any chance you all would either: (a) update the wasm artifacts to be esm compliant and make use of import.meta.url If you\'re able to do a full build of the wasm parts, please try this from a checkout of the current sqlite3 trunk: $ ./configure --enable-all $ make sqlite3.c shell.c $ cd ext/wasm $ make esm the difference from the current normal build is that it produces ext/wasm/jswasm/sqlite3.mjs instead of sqlite3.js, and Emscripten then makes use of import.meta for figuring out where to load the wasm file from. This does not change any of our own code, so it might not result in a working esm, but (A) that might not matter and (B) it might at least get us a step closer. The makefile does not currently build both sqlite3.js and sqlite3.mjs because they\'re separate builds from emscripten\'s point of view but would output sqlite3.wasm for both, so the builds would hammer each other when compiling in parallel. How we might best work around that is not yet clear, but we want to avoid shipping two separate wasm files if we can at all avoid it.

Thanks so much. I\'ll pull these down now and try them out. Prior to seeing your latest message(s) I had gotten the required changes down to a minimal set which you can see as a diff against the sqlite master branch here: https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commit/3c5b9f28a666a31170d01c4d61e6decc25f2a67d if that\'s useful to you. Obviously in your case you\'d want some checks (e.g., typeof import !== \'undefined\') in that code to make it work in non ES6 environments. Your current approach to sed\'ing the script is not maintainable Yep, definitely not. (9) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-03 23:56:12 in reply to 8 [link] [source] Obviously in your case you\'d want some checks (e.g., typeof import !== \'undefined\') in that code to make it work in non ES6 environments. It turns out that that approach is outright illegal. We\'re not allowed to use that symbol name at all in non-modules, even to check for its existence :(. That seems somewhat tyrannical but that\'s what Chrome is telling me. (12.1) By zainab on 2022-11-16 21:28:32 edited from 12.0 in reply to 9 [link] [source] The same is true for export. I\'m also interested in ES6 support and have added a few comments to the GitHub diff. For what it\'s worth, I\'ve managed to get this working with deno (and still be browser compatible) with the following one-liner to extern-post-js.js: - const originalInit = self.sqlite3InitModule; + const originalInit = sqlite3InitModule; This removes the explicit reference to the global self object and: In the case of an ES6 module, refers to the sqlite3InitModule declared in module scope. In the case of a browser script, refers to the sqlite3InitModule on the global object.

In the case of a browser script, refers to the sqlite3InitModule on the global object. but i\'m slowly coming to grasp why that change is necessary for ESM support. i\'ll patch that in the trunk copy. i\'m not happy about it, because i hate referencing global-scope symbols implicitly, but... so be it. (14.2) By Stephan Beal (stephan) on 2022-11-19 16:20:44 edited from 14.1 in reply to 1 [source] The WASM modules for SQLite aren\'t the easiest to import and use. Mainly because they don\'t conform to ESM and secondarily because they can\'t find the wasm and opfs-proxy locations on their own. That is very possibly remedied now. The trunk version now builds sqlite3.mjs along with sqlite3.js, where "".mjs"" is apparently the preferred extension for ES6 modules: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#aside_%E2%80%94_.mjs_versus_.js (Edit: funnily enough, that link works in Firefox but not Chrome. Search that page for "".mjs"" to find the relevant citation.) That file can be imported as a module with something like: <script type=""module""> import {default as sqlite3InitModule} from ""./jswasm/sqlite3.mjs""; sqlite3InitModule().then((sqlite3)=>{ console.log(""Loaded sqlite3"",sqlite3.version); }); </script> That build is now plugged in to our core testing process so will be tested along with the main build. What we don\'t yet test is running this build from a Worker because at least one major browser (Firefox) cannot load ES6 modules from workers: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247687 Edit: we now have test apps which load sqlite3 as an ES6 module both in the main thread and worker module (for browsers which support that (i.e. not Firefox)). A snapshot of this build is at: https://wasm-testing.sqlite.org/tmp/sqlite-wasm-3410000-snapshot.zip (Updated since the initial post to add ES6 worker module test app) but we make no guarantees whatsoever about how long it will remain there before being deleted. As this is our very first concentrated attempt at creating an ES6 module, any feedback on whether this works in your real-world applications would be greatly appreciated.

That isn\xe2\x80\x99t stopping him.By Will GottsegenJeenah Moon / Bloomberg / GettyNovember 19, 2022, 3:55 PM ETShareAfter losing more than $1 billion of his customers\xe2\x80\x99 money, the disgraced crypto titan Sam Bankman-Fried had just one thing to say.\xe2\x80\x9c1) What.\xe2\x80\x9dThat inscrutable message, posted on Twitter last weekend, followed a cataclysmic week for the 30-year-old. FTX, the cryptocurrency-trading site he\xe2\x80\x99d founded and turned into a global behemoth, went insolvent. Bankman-Fried\xe2\x80\x99s personal wealth plummeted from $15 billion to $0 in just one day, and the company filed for bankruptcy. Things have continued to deteriorate ever since, as a new, potentially criminal narrative has emerged: Federal prosecutors in New York have already begun contacting possible witnesses as part of a far-reaching investigation, and the white-shoe law firm Paul, Weiss has already dropped Bankman-Fried as a client.But as Bankman-Fried\xe2\x80\x99s empire lay smoldering and regulators began closing in, the man once considered the friendly face of crypto apparently figured he should just tweet through it. Over the course of the next 48 hours, that lone \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x9d was followed by a pattern of numbers and letters\xe2\x80\x94first \xe2\x80\x9c2) H,\xe2\x80\x9d indicating the beginning of a thread, then \xe2\x80\x9c3) A,\xe2\x80\x9d then \xe2\x80\x9c4) P\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94until a mesmerized public began to wise up. At some point, it seemed, Bankman-Fried would attempt to explain \xe2\x80\x9cwhat H-A-P-P-E-N-E-D\xe2\x80\x9d at FTX.Except he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, really. Instead, Bankman-Fried, or SBF, as he is known, has spent the past two weeks brazenly chattering his way through the chaos, using a combination of breathless apologies, cryptic poetry references, and unnervingly casual conversations with journalists to hammer in what FTX\xe2\x80\x99s creditors had already learned: that in spite of his trustworthy facade, Bankman-Fried still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand the gravity of his situation.It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a brilliant legal mind to know that if you\xe2\x80\x99re under any kind of scrutiny for crimes you may or may not have committed, the best course of action is to essentially shut up, lest you further implicate yourself. SBF has taken the opposite tack, granting at least two interviews to journalists. In the first, for The New York Times, Bankman-Fried announced that he was still sleeping pretty well despite the turmoil. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be worse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before adding that he\xe2\x80\x99d been spending recent days unwinding with video games. Here was Bankman-Fried attempting to remind readers that he\xe2\x80\x99s still the same old guy\xe2\x80\x94the implication being that maybe he was just naive after all. (Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment.)And earlier this week, SBF made another apparent stab at rehabilitating his reputation, this time in an interview with the journalist Kelsey Piper, at Vox, during which he made excuses (\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do sketchy stuff\xe2\x80\x9d), offered up meaningless bromides (\xe2\x80\x9cthe world is never so black and white\xe2\x80\x9d), and emphatically agreed with Piper\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that his ethics-first persona was \xe2\x80\x9cmostly a front.\xe2\x80\x9d At one point, letting the mask drop completely, he simply typed, \xe2\x80\x9cfuck regulators.\xe2\x80\x9d SBF later tweeted that he thought the interview, which happened over Twitter, was off the record, though when I spoke with Bankman-Fried last month, he took extreme care to specify which comments were and weren\xe2\x80\x99t on the record\xe2\x80\x94a product, I assumed, of careful media training.But what\xe2\x80\x99s now proving to be a serious liability, SBF\xe2\x80\x99s constant blabbering, was, until recently, his most powerful tool. In just a few years, SBF went from an arbitrageur in a niche market to one of the most powerful people in crypto. His unguardedness was always at the core of his appeal for the crypto-curious as the industry slowly broke into the mainstream; it was what made him stand out from the legions of anonymous crypto \xe2\x80\x9cdegens\xe2\x80\x9d with NFT profile pictures and embarrassing pseudonyms. Journalists have spent years hounding some crypto executives for a look at their companies\xe2\x80\x99 financials; SBF seemed to be gauging the health of his investments on Twitter in real time. And the idea that he was always accessible\xe2\x80\x94a friend to journalists and crypto podcasters everywhere, reachable both by private message and public exhortation\xe2\x80\x94served to bolster SBF\xe2\x80\x99s image as someone without much to hide. (He was as affable in the days leading up to FTX\xe2\x80\x99s filing for bankruptcy as he\xe2\x80\x99d been when I first got in touch with him, on Twitter in 2020.)He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite Jeff Bezos, whose tweets are professional to the point of awkwardness, and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite Elon Musk, whose tweets, especially lately, have demonstrated a penchant for brutish trolling. What made SBF so compelling, and ultimately so dangerous, is that he deeply understood the culture of crypto\xe2\x80\x94and of the broader internet\xe2\x80\x94even as he pushed against it. In an industry that hinges on anonymity, and on the idea that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to disclose too much information, SBF seemed to want to show you exactly who he was.Even now that much of that mystique has been peeled away, SBF\xe2\x80\x99s inability to just shut up is doing him no favors. The newly appointed FTX CEO, John Jay Ray III, best known for mopping up the corporate failures at Enron in the mid-2000s, described his predecessor in a recent court filing as unable to stop making \xe2\x80\x9cerratic and misleading public statements\xe2\x80\x9d even as his world crumbles around him. \xe2\x80\x9cNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls,\xe2\x80\x9d he also wrote. Indeed, each new revelation just seems to make SBF look worse and worse. Ray\xe2\x80\x99s filing also revealed a previously undisclosed $1 billion loan that seems to have gone directly into SBF\xe2\x80\x99s own pockets.After apparently misleading the industry for years, and even after incinerating tens of billions of dollars, it feels like SBF still sees himself as somehow holding sway over the people in his orbit. His image is not that of a villain, although that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what SBF-the-man seems to be. His incessant, unguarded posting was once an extension of an earnest persona, carefully cultivated. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s just sad.'"

Features No IFD. Just plain Nix. Macros (non-hygienic) Nix interop Shares most of its data types with Nix Contains syntax support and helpers to use Nix lists and attrsets Can call Nix functions seamlessly Can export functions that can be called from Nix Example (import ./default.nix).eval {} \'\' (define nixpkgs (fetchTarball \'url ""https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/archive/a39ee95a86b1fbdfa9edd65f3810b23d82457241.tar.gz"" \'sha256 ""11sk5hz51189g6a5ahq3s1y65145ra8kcgzfjkmrjp1jzn7h68q8"")) (define pkgs (import nixpkgs (attrs))) ((pkgs \'haskellPackages \'ghcWithPackages) (lambda (ps) (vector (ps \'relude) (ps \'pipes)))) \'\' Current state It\'s kinda-sorta working. It can use Nix values and call Nix functions. It is probably not very performant, and is easy to hit the stack limit. There standard library is pretty minimal, but since it\'s easy to use Nix builtins and nixpkgs functions, I do not expect it to be the biggest problem. PR\'s very welcome. Docs Standard library See stdlib.nixlisp. It is also the best place look for examples. Defining a function (defun myDouble (x) (define two 2) (+ x two)) defun is a macro; the above function expands to: (define myDouble (lambda (x) (begin (define two 2) (+ x two)))) Defining a macro (defmacro cond args (defun go (xs) (if (nil? xs) \'nil (begin (define clause (car xs)) (define condition (car clause)) (define value (car (cdr clause))) (list \'if condition value (go (cdr xs)))))) (go args)) Defining an attribute set (attrs \'firstKey ""foo"" \'anotherKey 12 \'yetAnotherKey (vector 1 2 3)) Types Nix Nixlisp int int string string bool bool null nil function nix-function attrs attrs list vector - lambda - symbol - cons - macro float (not implemented yet) path (not implemented yet) Nix compatibility Types that are unique to Nixlisp are implemented as attribute sets with a special tag on Nix side. They are not meant to be accessed, but you can pass them back to Nixlisp. Nixlisp lambda\'s can be called as normal functions from the Nix side, but they have to have at least one named parameter, and can not have variable numbero of arguments. Macros can not be called from Nix. nix-function\'s can be called just as lambda\'s within Nixlisp. Since they are curried by default, all of the parameters will be passed to them one after another. Attribute sets behave like functions, where you can pass them strings or symbols and they can do a lookup. Beware that a Nixlisp ""list"" (a nil-terminated cons-list) is not a Nix ""list"". A Nix list is called a ""vector"", and you can use the vector, or list->vector functions to construct them. Thanks nprindle/nix-parsec About No description, website, or topics provided.

His lies fooled newspapers, teachers and officials. Then a teenager flagged up something that everyone else had missed.""I read through Wikipedia a lot when I\'m bored in class,"" says Adam, aged 15, who studies photography and ICT at a school in Kent.One day last July, one of his teachers mentioned the online encyclopaedia\'s entry about Alan MacMasters, who it said was a Scottish scientist from the late 1800s and had invented ""the first electric bread toaster"".At the top of the page was a picture of a man with a pronounced quiff and long sideburns, gazing contemplatively into the distance - apparently a relic of the 19th Century, the photograph appeared to have been torn at the bottom. But Adam was suspicious. ""It didn\'t look like a normal photo,"" he tells me. ""It looked like it was edited.""Image caption, This ""Alan MacMasters"" Wikipedia article stayed online for more than nine yearsAfter he went home, he decided to post about his suspicions on a forum devoted to Wikipedia vandalism.Little did he know that he had just set in motion a chain of events that would lead me to ""Alan MacMasters"" - not the inventor of the electric toaster, but his real-life alter ego.Inventor who never wasUntil recently, if you had searched for ""Alan MacMasters"" on Wikipedia, you would have found the same article that Adam did. And who would have doubted it?After all, like most Wikipedia articles, this one was peppered with references: news articles, books and websites that supposedly provided evidence of MacMasters\' life and legacy. As a result, lots of people accepted that MacMasters had been real.More than a dozen books, published in various languages, named him as the inventor of the toaster. And, until recently, even the Scottish government\'s Brand Scotland website listed the electric toaster as an example of the nation\'s ""innovative and inventive spirit"". In his supposed home country, MacMasters had become a folk hero of sorts.One Scottish primary school organised a day of activities in his memory - children were invited to write journal entries about MacMasters, paint slices of toast, and build pretend toasters out of building blocks.Edinburgh-based chef Scott Smith also created an elaborate dessert in his honour, while taking part in Great British Menu, the BBC cookery show. Smith says MacMasters\' name was suggested to him by the producers, but they didn\'t respond to our requests for comment.In 2018, when the Bank of England asked the British public who should appear on the next \xc2\xa350 note, MacMasters was nominated - and included on a list along with 988 other apparently eligible contenders who had made significant contributions to science.The Bank of England did not want to comment on this story, but confirmed MacMasters had been dropped from the longlist after extra checks were made.All the while, as the world got to know the supposed Scottish inventor, there was someone in London who could not avoid a smirk as the name ""Alan MacMasters"" popped up - again and again - on his screen.Image source, Alan MacMastersImage caption, Aerospace engineer Alan MacMastersAlan MacMasters, 30, is an aerospace engineer from London ""and not the inventor of the toaster"", he assures me with a giggle. ""You shouldn\'t just believe everything you read on the internet.""I feel nervous about the possibility of falling prey to another prank. So I ask Alan to send me a photo of his passport, which he does. He is not lying: even if he lacks the voluminous quiff of his namesake, he really is Alan MacMasters (""half Japanese and half Scottish"", he adds by text).""One day, my father said to me: \'Maybe we are related to the inventor of the toaster?\' And I had to disappoint him,"" he recalls.And that was because Alan knew the truth: he was there when the toaster hoax began more than a decade ago.MacMasters\' legend bornOn 6 February 2012, Alan was at a university lecture, when the class was warned against using Wikipedia as a source. To hammer the point home, the lecturer said that a friend of his - one ""Maddy Kennedy"" - had named himself on the site as the inventor of the toaster.Alan and his classmates found the story ""amusing"" but pondered correcting the article - after all, one of Wikipedia\'s distinguishing features is that pretty much anyone can edit it.Sitting right next to Alan was one of his closest friends, Alex, who volunteered to do the editing himself. Alex recalls: ""I just changed it so that it said that my friend, who sat next to me, Alan MacMasters, had in fact invented the toaster in Edinburgh in 1893.""We had no idea who invented the toaster.""Internet history had just been made, but Alan was not bothered.""Alex is a bit of a joker, it\'s part of why we love him,"" he says. ""The article had already been vandalised anyway, it was just changing the nature of the incorrect information. I thought it was funny, I never expected it to last.""Listen to The Alan MacMasters\' Toaster Hoax on BBC SoundsWikipedia relies on volunteers to ensure articles are as accurate as they can be. This involves checking articles are properly sourced, clearly written, and that - in general - they have not been vandalised or tampered with. But it is a huge job. On English Wikipedia alone, there are more than 6.5 million articles and fewer than 125,000 regular editors. It is almost inevitable that some articles will fall through the cracks - and the article exploring the origins of the toaster was one of them.""At the time, we had a good laugh about the change, but we quickly forgot about it,"" says Alex, the hoaxer.But the internet does not forget.From that day onwards, anyone who looked up the inventor of the toaster on Wikipedia would have found ""Alan MacMasters"" as the answer. And it was not long before the Daily Mirror wrongly listed MacMasters\' toaster as a ""life-changing everyday invention that put British genius on the map"". Reach, which owns the Mirror, declined to comment.Alex felt mischievous, and wondered how far his prank could go. He asked himself what would happen if he created a Wikipedia article entirely devoted to the supposed inventor of the toaster.More importantly, he wondered how long it would be before the platform\'s volunteer editors exposed his forgery.In February 2013, Alan MacMasters\' very own Wikipedia article was born.Image caption, The supposed photograph of ""Alan MacMasters"" made schoolboy Adam suspiciousTo illustrate it, Alex grabbed a photo of himself and edited it to look like an image from the 1800s - this was the very same photo that, years later, would catch Adam\'s eye.At the time, Alex felt this was a harmless prank. ""If you get false information about who invented the toaster, the consequences might be that you get a question wrong in a pub quiz,"" he says. ""It\'s a bit of trivia, which doesn\'t have a significant real-world impact.""But was that really the case? Soon, the name ""Alan MacMasters"" would spread rapidly around the world as the inventor of the toaster. Over more than a decade, his life story was retold by major news outlets, official bodies and even a US museum.The more people became aware of MacMasters, the more complex Alex\'s deception became.""The article started out as just a couple of sentences and, over time, I decided to start writing more and more ridiculous things,"" he says. Among other details, he falsely suggested MacMasters had helped develop lighting systems for the London Underground.""These [claims] would get picked up in different types of media, I would cite them, and they would become fact,"" Alex says. Image source, Andre MorawskiImage caption, Heather Ford says the hoax highlights Wikipedia\'s role in ""determining what gets recognised as true""This may well be part of the reason why the MacMasters hoax survived for so long.""What you have here is circular referencing,"" says Heather Ford, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney. When journalists repeat a claim that is made online, their reporting can then be used on Wikipedia as evidence to back the original claim.""Wikipedia is just collecting all of these sources and citations, as it continues to build this article that originally was built on this lie,"" Ford says.MacMasters walks into sunset For years, no one appears to have raised any suspicions online - at least, until 15-year-old Adam posted his concerns on a Reddit forum. His thread was titled: ""The picture of the inventor of the toaster on Wikipedia was faked.""At this stage, Adam was unaware that Scottish inventor Alan MacMasters was not real - only that the photo used to illustrate his Wikipedia article appeared to be fake.""A lot of people actually replied: \'I have used that picture in a presentation for school,\'"" Adam recalls. ""I thought it was hilarious.""But after his post went live, it was rapidly shared on Wikipediocracy, a forum known for scrutinising the online encyclopaedia. This in turn alerted Wikipedia editors who, in less than 24 hours, had nominated the article for deletion. Within a week, a ""hoax"" label had been added at the top of the article. And, in September, the article was changed so that anyone looking for MacMasters on Wikipedia was redirected to a page about hoaxes instead. Alex\'s Wikipedia account, which he used to create the MacMasters article, has been blocked. The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, tells the BBC it takes hoaxes and misinformation ""very seriously"". It accepts hoaxes take place ""from time to time"", but says the site is protected ""through a combination of machine learning tools and human oversight from volunteer editors"". It also says misinformation and hoaxes are ""generally addressed by volunteers via existing rules and processes"", and that they are ""outside of the Wikimedia Foundation\'s remit"". In a statement, it says: ""In general, the Foundation only gets involved in content related issues on the platform in case of specific cases of disinformation or legal matters.""The real inventorGetting to the bottom of this mystery was not easy. I spoke to toaster collectors in Europe and in the US, as well as museum curators with expertise in domestic appliances. According to multiple sources, the first patent for a commercially available and successful toaster was submitted by Frank Shailor in 1909, on behalf of the General Electric company in the US.The toaster, named the D-12, is understood to be the first commercially available electric toaster.Image source, IngeniumImage caption, The D-12 toaster, created by Frank Shailor in 1909 for General Electric""It is beautiful,"" says Rebecca Dolgoy, curator of natural resources and industrial technologies at Ingenium, Canada\'s museums of science and innovation (which hold two D-12 toasters).""You would put the bread inside, it would toast one side at a time, and you would have to switch it. The machine is very elegant, but also utilitarian.""As I speak to her, I notice the passion in Ms Dolgoy\'s words. ""I\'m interested in the toasters because they are fascinating, but also because of the kinds of stories that they allow us to tell,"" she tells me.And the story of Alan MacMasters, the inventor, is certainly one of them. It just happens not to be true.Related TopicsDisinformationFake NewsTop StoriesUN climate talks go into the night to reach a dealPublished1 hour agoFifa boss accuses West of World Cup hypocrisyPublished14 hours agoBenzema out of Qatar World CupPublished2 hours agoFeaturesWhy US election results are taking so longWeekly quiz: What was Trump\'s nickname for rival?Controversial World Cup set to get under wayKatty Kay: My interview with election-denier Kari Lake\xe2\x80\x98Dropbox\xe2\x80\x99 babies - the surrendered infants in USHow a North Korean defector became a fight champion.

But more than anything, people are using the term to describe a new class of software. Tools for thought is now a category tag in the databases of venture capital firms. The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new knowledge management app: Even when it doesn\'t appear verbatim, we can see it in the subtext. These tools are here to help you \xe2\x80\x9cthink better,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cachieve more\xe2\x80\x9d. These software apps appear to have a clear vision of what a ""tool for thought"" is. It appears to involve writing notes, connecting them together, exploring dynamic views, and then experiencing a kind of emergent wisdom. An enchanting promise. Yet there\'s something paradoxical here; the phrase itself and the way we\'re collectively using it feel misaligned. Taken at face value, the phrase tool for thought doesn\'t have the word \'computer\' or \'digital\' anywhere in it. It suggests nothing about software systems or interfaces. It\'s simply meant to refer to tools that help humans think thoughts; potentially new, different, and better kinds of thoughts than we currently think. While this might seem like a dumb rhetorical question, what does any of this have to do with computers? I think it\'s a question worth answering explicitly and comprehensively. If only to make clear to ourselves why we currently consider apps that allow you to link notes together the epitome of a tool for thought. What is a tool for thought? We\'re a bit too early in the establishment of this concept for anyone to have written a canonical definition yet. And like all significantly complex ideas, any proposed ones will be contested and controversial. We can, however, get a rough estimation by looking at descriptions from some of the key texts we pass around the community. A tool for thought is... \xe2\x80\x9cA context in which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that were formerly impossible for them\xe2\x80\x9dAndy Matuschak & Michael Neilson \xe2\x80\x93 How can we develop transformative tools for thought? (2019) \xe2\x80\x9cA means of increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems.\xe2\x80\x9dDouglas Englebart \xe2\x80\x93 Augmenting Human Intellect (1962) \xe2\x80\x9cA truly new medium [where] the very use of it would change the thought patterns of an entire civilization\xe2\x80\x9dAlan Kay \xe2\x80\x93 User Interface: A Personal View (1989) Looking a these, it\'s easy to think of plenty of examples from human history of tools for thought that fit the bill. Here\'s a brief list: Written language \xe2\x80\x93 3200 BCEDrawing \xe2\x80\x93 ~73,000 years agoMaps \xe2\x80\x93 700 BCEHindu-arabic numerals \xe2\x80\x93 400 BCEEpic poetry as oral history \xe2\x80\x93 ~2000 BCEThe socratic method \xe2\x80\x93 500 BCEThe scientific method \xe2\x80\x93 1000~1400 BCECartesian coordinates \xe2\x80\x93 1637Zettelkastens \xe2\x80\x93 1500sAboriginal songlines \xe2\x80\x93 ~60,000 years agoSpreadsheetsData visualisation \xe2\x80\x93 1785 Each of these examples profoundly transformed the kinds of thoughts humans can think. They expanded our cognitive abilities and allowed us to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable. It might feel strange to call some of these things \xe2\x80\x9ctools\xe2\x80\x9d. The scientific and socratic methods seem more like techniques for problem-solving. While drawing and writing are surely mediums or representations of ideas rather than \xe2\x80\x9ctools\xe2\x80\x9d? Part of this discomfort is a limitation of language. \xe2\x80\x9cTool\xe2\x80\x9d is a tricky category that we most often associate with physical objects. But we also use it to refer to less tangible techniques and mediums: fire, software development kits, slam poetry, democratic voting systems, design thinking, metaphors, and Google search filters are also called \xe2\x80\x9ctools.\xe2\x80\x9d I do think there\'s a meaningful distinction between tools and mediums: tools are a means of working in a medium. They enable specific tasks and workflows. Mediums are a means of communicating a thought or expressing an idea. Cameras are a tool that let people express ideas through photography. Blogging is a tool that lets people express ideas through written language. JavaScript is a tool that let people express ideas through programming. Tools and mediums require each other. This makes line between them fuzzy. And I\'m unconvinced there\'s much utility in sharpening them. I\'m going to proceed with a generous definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctool\xe2\x80\x9d for the rest of this piece. We could spend time splitting hairs and trying to hash out these categories. Or we could plough on by accepting any object, cultural practice, technique, or medium that expands human abilities as a tool. This gives us a mental model that looks something like this: Most of the examples I listed above are cultural practices and techniques. They are primary ways of doing; specific ways of thinking and acting that result in greater cognitive abilities. Ones that people pass down from generation to generation through culture. Every one of these also pre-dates digital computers by at least a few hundred years, if not thousands or tens of thousands. Given that framing, it\'s time to return to the question of how computation, software objects, and note-taking apps fit into this narrative. The Computational Roots of Tools for Thought My simple interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ctools for thought\xe2\x80\x9d up to this point takes the phrase at face value \xe2\x80\x93 devoid of any historical context. Any sincere and holistic exporation of the phrase has to consider who came up with the term, and what particular cultural and historical contexts they were part of. If you look around at the commonly cited \xe2\x80\x9cmajor thinkers\xe2\x80\x9d in this space, you get a list of computer programmers: Kenneth Iverson, J.C.R. Licklider, Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay, Bob Taylor, Douglas Englebart, Seymour Papert, Bret Victor, and Howard Rheingold, among others. I would be remiss not to point out all of these figures are male, white, from North America, and associated with various prestigious technical universities such as MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and UC Berkley. Most were hanging out in California from the 1960s up through the 1990s working advances in networked computing and personal computing. This demographic is so overwhelmingly consistent that they\'re sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9cpatriarchs\xe2\x80\x9d of tools for thought. This is relevant because it means these men share a lot of the same beliefs, values, and context. They know the same sorts of people, learned the same historical stories in school and were taught to see the world in particular kinds of ways. Most of them worked together, or are at most 1 personal connection away from the next. Tools for thought is a community scene as much as it\'s a concept. This gives tools for thought a distinctly computer-oriented, male, American, middle-class flavour. The term has always been used in relation to a dream that is deeply intertwined with digital machines, white-collar knowledge work, and bold American optimism. A Short Historical Tour of TFT The phrase itself is not that old. It was first used by Kenneth Iverson in his research work on programming notation throughout the 1950s and \'60s.. His first public paper mentioning it is published by the ACM in 1979. Iverson argued that establishing shared notation within a discipline \xe2\x80\x93 be it biological, mathematical, or programmatic \xe2\x80\x93 can relieve our working memory and compress complex meanings into concise forms. While Iverson was the first to give this idea a distinct name, others were already exploring many of the same themes using different terms. Vannevar Bush Memex.J.C.R. Licklider wrote Man-Computer Symbiosis - presented the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cthinking centre\xe2\x80\x9dOne of the more significant bodies of work is \'s , published in 1962.After Bush, Licklider, and Englebart\'s well-publicised presentations and writing made the rounds, many other thinkers became interested in the problem of expanding human reasoning with machines. Much of the relevant innovation happened at where thinkers like and built the foundations of modern personal computing. Kay\'s team chose to talk about it in terms of giving people \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal dynamic media\xe2\x80\x9d to think with. In his 1989 essay , Kay...Much of this history is outlined in Howard Rheingold\'s 1985 book \xe2\x80\x93 an account of major innovations that led to the personal computer and the philsophical lineage of those building it. Michael Hiltzik\'s also recounts a lot of the work done at Xerox PARC.I\'ll refrain from recounting the entire history here. My point is that all of these thinkers exclusively focus on computers as essential to enabling new ways of thinking. They aren\'t exploring how meditation, architecture, complementary medicine, or music composition might enable new kinds of thoughts. The computer is essential.Now is a good time to point out that plenty of people have used the phrase outside of the context of computers. , a biologist and philosopher, published a book by the same name as Rheingold eight years earlier in 1977. In it, he explores the nature of complex systems and discusses philosophies and problem-solving tools for wicked problems. Computers are mentioned in passing but are never the focus.Barbara Tversky has four decades of research on cognition, embodiment, and visualation where she repeatedly uses the term. The philosopher Daniel Dennett published Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking in 2013We\'ll return to these non-computational interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9ctools for thought\xe2\x80\x9d later on. They shouldn\'t be dismissed or cast as irrelevant to the narratives that computer nerds have written.Computers as the Meta-mediumIs this particular focus on computers justified?Alan Turing first called computers \xe2\x80\x9cuniversal reasoning machines\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 machines capable of simulating many other kind of machines. General purpose machines expand what is possible. Computers as a meta-medium that can mimic all other kinds of mediums. They mimic paper and pencil, calculators, painting canvases...Computers can dynamically simulate""Computers are without a doubt the most potent thinking tools we have, not just because they take the drudgery out of many intellectual tasks, but also because many of the concepts computer scientists have invented are excellent thinking tools in their own right."" - Dennett (2013)It would be more accurate to rename tools for thought to computational mediums for thought. Or CMFT for short.CMFT would actually be a subset of the larger field of tools for thought, since as we established earlier, the vast majority of historical tools for thought are not in the least bit computational.[image of CMFT as a subset of TFT]Which should make us pause to ask: Are CMFT\'s significantly different to other TFTs?The Second Wave of Tools for ThoughtA major narrative within the tools for thought community is the loss of historical progress. There\'s a lot of lamenting the historical break between the early pioneers of personal computing and the current state of computing. The nineties and early oughts are cast as the fallow times. While software \xe2\x80\x9c,\xe2\x80\x9d millions came online, and Windows 95 graced every desktop, this period is seen as a turn away from the original vision.Bret Victor was the first to call attention to this historical gap in a series of talks between 2013 to 2015. and \'s 2019 essay on helped kick off the new popularity wave, as well as Andy\'s and writing advocating for TFT as a field.Matuschak and Neilson\'s essay made a dent in the software development community.Rise of the Note-takersAround the end of 2019, as Matuschak and Neilson\'s essay is being passed around, we begin to see the rise of a few new ""note-taking"" apps. I put ""note-taking"" in quotations because the activity we\'re going to talk about here is only tangentially about taking notes, but we\'ve all taken to using the idea of note-taking as a shorthand way to refer to it.What we are talking about is software that allows people to enagage in a few key activities: Write in a linear text format Collect information Store information Search and find information Connect information Before this moment, the major players in the market are tools like Evernote, OneNote, Notion, and Apple Notes. There are plenty of smaller apps serving niche use cases. But there\'s a clear inflection point in mid-2020 in this field where the number and diversity of \xe2\x80\x9cnote-taking\xe2\x80\x9d applications drastically increases. [need evidence for this claim] is one of the central software characters in this story. In late 2019 and early 2020 the beta version gains a slew of new usersObsidian comes out in xxxx.

At this point it seems the floodgates are open.In short order we get Clover, Craft, Remnote, Mem.ai, Scrintal, Heptabase, Reflect, Muse, Thunknotes, Kosmik, Fermat, and XXX.There\'s a scramble to make sense of all these new releases and the differences between them. YouTube and Medium explode with DIY guides, walkthrough tours, and comparison videos. The productivity and knowledge management influencer is born.[ giant wall of productivity youtube nonsense ]The strange thing is, many of these guides are only superficially about the application they\'re presented in. Most are teaching specific cultural techniques:Zettelkasten, spaced repetition, critical thinking.These techniques are only focused on a narrow band of human activity. Specifically activity that white-collar knowledge workers engage in.I previously sugegsted we should rename TFT to CMFT (computational mediums for thought), but that doesn\'t go far enough.

138,Power Struggles Among Nice People (edbatista.com),https://www.edbatista.com/2022/03/power-struggles-among-nice-people.html,6,"b'Power Struggles Among Nice People (Ed Batista) Ed Batista About Resources Contact \xc2\xab Middle-Aged Men and Ponytails | Main | Should You Apologize? (It Depends) \xc2\xbb Mar 21, 2022 Power Struggles Among Nice People Most of my clients are CEOs of growing companies, most of the rest are C-level executives in similar settings, and a number of others are leaders in investment or professional services firms. In order to be effective in these roles they must be able to influence others, wield authority, and maintain status. At the same time my clients are conscientious people who care about the well-being of their employees and colleagues, aspire to make a positive difference in the world, and are striving to do their best. As a result of these factors, a theme in my practice is what I describe as ""power struggles among nice people."" And yet a challenge is that many of us imagine that people who engage in power struggles aren\'t very nice, and that nice people shouldn\'t struggle for power. This leaves us with a stark choice: Be an asshole and win, or be a decent person and lose--but it doesn\'t have to be that way. 1. The Ubiquity of Power Struggles We often think of a power struggle as a rancorous, zero-sum battle between bitter enemies, but that\'s just one version, and it\'s relatively rare. Far more common are the everyday efforts noted above: influencing others, wielding authority, maintaining status. Consider how often we engage in these activities every single day, and how infrequently we employ formal decision-making frameworks or conflict-resolution tools in the process. From this perspective we can define a power struggle in much less charged terms: any situation in which the parties must assert themselves to overcome resistance and achieve their preferred outcome. There are no cartoon villains and few outsized expressions of force in these everyday power struggles. As I\'ve noted before, force and power are not the same thing--force is ""strength or energy as an attribute of action,"" while power as ""the ability to produce an effect."" [1] Most power struggles are rather mundane affairs, and in this sense we might think of them as the ""dark matter"" of organizational life--they affect almost everything but escape observation unless we\'re paying close attention. [2] Why are power struggles so common? There\'s certainly a connection with our origins as a species. Primates rely on social structures to obtain resources and to defeat or evade threats, and humans possess the singular advantage of being able to cooperate in larger groups than our evolutionary rivals. [3] This has allowed us to dominate the planet, but as a consequence we face much greater competition from within the group, and we\'ve had to develop a complex set of social skills to assert our preferences while minimizing intra-group conflict. [4] A similar pattern of constant, non-violent power struggles can be observed in the chimpanzee, which, notably, is the only other species of great ape whose social groups include multiple males that co-exist in a shifting dominance hierarchy. [5] But we may wonder why humans continue to rely on informal displays of power to accomplish these goals. Why don\'t we utilize the other decision-making frameworks and conflict-resolution tools that we\'ve developed more frequently? Because power struggles are often more effective than those alternatives. 2. The Desirability of Power Struggles When defined as ""zero-sum battles between bitter rivals,"" power struggles are obviously undesirable. Such efforts waste time and resources, cause needless division, and serve as distractions from more productive activities. But when we recognize a broader definition, it becomes apparent that power struggles are more efficient or less costly than the alternatives, which generally fall into one of three categories: voting, consensus, and hierarchy. Voting is possible only under a highly specific set of circumstances: Decision-making authority can be fairly apportioned by vote, whether by person, ownership share, or some other method. All parties agree that a decision must be made at a certain point in time, after which further efforts to influence the outcome will be counter-productive. And the most powerful parties can be trusted to abide by the outcome when a vote doesn\'t go their way. We can easily see why voting is used so rarely in organizational life--although it\'s worth noting that votes are preceded by campaigns to win support in which expressions of power may figure heavily. Consensus also comes with necessary preconditions: All parties must reach agreement in order to move forward, and even the least powerful figure has the authority to withhold approval. Complicating matters is the contemporary preference for the appearance of egalitarianism, which often results in a half-hearted attempt at obtaining consensus that inevitably stalls, at which point the most powerful party pulls rank and dispenses with the charade, resulting in a full-blown power struggle. But even in an authentic attempt to reach consensus, the discussions and debates that comprise the process are themselves a type of power struggle. While there are companies, industries, and even parts of the world where hierarchy remains a primary means of decision-making and conflict resolution, that\'s not the case in my clients\' organizations. To a large extent this is the result of two related trends in management over the past century: the increasing importance of the ""knowledge worker"" [6] and the move away from centralized command-and-control structures. [7] My clients and almost all of their employees and colleagues are knowledge workers of one sort or another, and in this context the leader who merely issues directives will eventually a price. Knowledge workers put a high value on latitude and autonomy, and they have a low tolerance for being repeatedly overruled. But while leaders might refrain from relying explicitly on hierarchy to avoid alienating their employees, this isn\'t to suggest that hierarchy is absent or irrelevant. Hierarchical distinctions are a constant presence even in the flattest organizations [8], and parties engaged in a power struggle may exploit any such advantages in their efforts to prevail. But the subtle use of a hierarchical distinction while conducting a power struggle is very different than a dictatorial command. In these settings, most directives imposed via hierarchy can be viewed as the outcomes of failed power struggles, in which the leader had hoped to avoid ""giving an order."" [9] So we see that alternative means of decision-making and conflict-resolution come with constraints that render them impractical in many circumstances, and that even when such means are employed the process typically involves a series of power struggles. Given these conditions, we might imagine that anyone who aspires to succeed as a leader would be ready to engage in power struggles on a regular basis--and yet that\'s not always the case. Many leaders in my practice report feeling surprised when power struggles occur, resentful of the obligation to participate in them, and depleted by the demands of the process. Why is this? What prevents these leaders from being better prepared for and more effective at engaging in this fundamental feature of organizational life? 3. The Problem with Nice People As noted above, my clients can be characterized as ""high-achieving nice people,"" and in my experience many nice people are uncomfortable with displays of power and put a premium on maintaining interpersonal harmony, which puts them at a disadvantage when they\'re obligated to assert themselves and overcome resistance in order to obtain a desired outcome. Further, if they continue to emphasize personal achievement over cultivating power and influence, they eventually limit their professional success. To understand why, we turn to the work of the eminent 20th-century psychologist David McClelland, one of the leading scholars on human motivation, who theorized that people are driven primarily by three distinct needs [10]: The need for achievement, or ""doing something better for its own sake, or to show [that one] is more capable of doing something."" [11] The need for power, or concern ""about having \'impact, control, or influence over another person, group, or the world at large.\'"" [12] The need for affiliation, ""or the need to be with people""\xc2\xa0and a concern with ""establishing, maintaining, or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons."" [13] McClelland also studied people\'s capacity for ""activity inhibition,"" or impulse control, and his research showed that the most successful senior leaders display 1) a relatively high need for power, 2) a relatively low need for affiliation, and 3) a high degree of impulse control, a distinctive pattern that he called ""leadership motive syndrome."" McClelland found that people who possessed this combination of traits were most likely to obtain senior leadership positions, ultimately outpacing those who merely had a high need for achievement. [14] The latter group\'s focus on improved performance and desire for personal feedback helped them succeed at the outset of their careers, but limited their effectiveness at scale when results must be obtained not merely through individual effort but through the ability to lead others, and when feedback cycles are long and unpredictable. [15] In addition, McClelland noted that people with a high need for affiliation often have shortcomings as leaders as they strive to avoid conflict and prioritize warm relationships. [16] These conclusions pose some significant challenges for ""nice high-achievers"": Nice people underestimate the importance of power and influence in long-term success at senior levels. They overestimate the importance of personal achievement and being liked. A consequent reluctance to engage in everyday power struggles prevents them from learning how to display power and exert influence effectively. But a deeper understanding of this research makes clear that ""nice people"" aren\'t doomed to underachieve--and even possess several key advantages. 4. The Opportunity for Nice People Let\'s highlight the relative dimension of McClelland\'s ""leadership motive syndrome."" It\'s not the case that effective senior leaders must possess the greatest possible need for power, or that a high need for affiliation is an inherent barrier to a senior role. The point is simply that their need for power must be relatively higher than their need for affiliation--in other words, senior leaders can\'t allow a desire to be liked or a preference for harmony to prevent them from displaying power or exerting influence when necessary. Further, note the importance of impulse control in the most effective senior leaders. An alternative pattern of traits identified by McClelland was 1) a high need for power, 2) a low need for affiliation, and 3) a low degree of impulse control, which he called ""conquistador syndrome."" [17] Leaders who exhibit this pattern may enjoy some success, but their self-aggrandizing displays of power limit their effectiveness at senior levels, as McClelland and his colleague David Burnham concluded in a summary of their research: The top manager of a company must possess a high need for power--that is, a concern for influencing people. However, this need must be disciplined and controlled so that it is directed toward the benefit of the institution as a whole and not toward the manager\'s personal aggrandizement... We discovered one more fact in studying the better managers... They were more mature. Mature people can be most simply described as less egotistic. Somehow their positive self-image is not at stake in their jobs. They are less defensive, more willing to seek advice from experts, and have a longer-range view. [18] Put differently, the most successful senior leaders have a substantial capacity for emotion regulation. [19] They don\'t allow fleeting feelings to translate into counter-productive behavior. As McClelland noted, people with a high need for power think about ""carrying out a number of impulsive aggressive acts...but they did not in fact do them more often"" than people with a low need for power. [20] And nice people typically share that capacity for emotion regulation (even if it\'s often put to use in efforts to generate warmth and evoke positive feelings in others.) Finally, observations from my practice suggest that nice people are likely to rank high on two dimensions of ""emotional style"" identified by neuroscientist Richard Davidson that are relevant here: 1) context-sensitivity, or the ability to grasp what will be perceived as appropriate in a given situation and tailor one\'s behavior accordingly, and 2) social intuition, or the ability to assess others\' mental and emotional states on the basis of body language, tone of voice, and similar data. [21] In sum, while nice people may have to overcome some self-imposed obstacles in order to engage in everyday power struggles, they\'re also likely to possess several characteristics that will enable them to be more effective in the process. So if you identify with this description--if you\'re a ""nice high-achiever""--where do you go from here? 5. Putting It Into Practice A note on social identity, including, but not limited to, gender and orientation, race and ethnicity, education and class background: I\'m keenly aware that in many settings the behaviors that convey power and influence are historically associated with people who already hold power and influence. I realize that if you don\'t match that description in your organizational context you may well face additional obstacles when your efforts to exert power and influence run counter to the expectations imposed upon you as a result of your social identity. That said, I\'m equally aware that merely conforming to those expectations is a likely path to frustration and underachievement. When we\'re not in a position to change the surrounding culture, one of the key steps is determining how to conform just enough to that culture to avoid being rejected by it while also\xc2\xa0ensuring that the culture doesn\'t dictate our behavior to our disadvantage--which is a challenge I\'ve addressed with many ""nice high-achievers"" in my practice over the years. [22] Our needs for achievement, power and affiliation are informed by a range of sources, from our family environments as children to our education and professional training to the culture at large. But if we determine that our current needs are resulting in behaviors that make it more difficult to achieve our goals, we can change our approach with a degree of self-awareness, deliberate effort, and practice over time. (McClelland noted the efficacy of management training workshops in helping leaders modify their styles and deliver improved results. [23]) It\'s also evident to me from my years as a coach and experiential educator that we can (and must) distinguish between our personal preferences and what is being asked of us in a given situation, and that effective leaders consistently get out of their comfort zone to experiment with new behaviors, even (and especially) when such efforts feel awkward or inauthentic. If you identify as a ""nice high-achiever,"" I suspect that being more assertive to overcome resistance and obtain your desired outcome will feel uncomfortable--and I\'m absolutely certain that you needn\'t allow such feelings to stand in your way. I\'m hopeful that this reading provides a useful starting point in that process--and it\'s just a starting point. What\'s next? Consider your beliefs about power and influence and how they affect your approach to everyday power struggles: Self-Awareness, Empowerment and Choice [PDF] (Patricia Day Williams, Chapter 7.10 in Reading Book for Human Relations Training, edited by Alfred Cooke, Michael Brazzel, Argentine Saunders Craig and Barbara Greig, 1999) Interpersonal Power Corn Mazes and Mental Models Learn more about the means by which power and influence are displayed and the behaviors that convey power and influence: Force Isn\'t Power Weather Systems (Power, Charisma and Leadership) The Value of a Good Fight Power Play (Jeffrey Pfeffer, Harvard Business Review, 2010) Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don\'t (Jeffrey Pfeffer, 2010) Political Skill at Work: How to Influence, Motivate and Win Support (Gerald Ferris, Sherry Davidson and Pamela Perrew\xc3\xa9, 2005 / 2nd edition, 2020) Harnessing the Science of Persuasion (Robert Cialdini, Harvard Business Review, 2001) The Language of Persuasion (Robert Cialdini, Harvard Business Review, 2008) Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (Robert Cialdini, 1984 / 3rd edition, 2021) Why It Pays to Be a Jerk (Jerry Useem, The Atlantic, 2015) Actively experiment with alternative approaches, especially any that feel uncomfortable or inauthentic: Attitude and Behavior Conscious Competence In Practice Why Change Is Hard Comfort with Discomfort Leadership and Authenticity The Tyranny of Feelings Get regular feedback and integrate it into your ongoing efforts: Make Getting Feedback Less Stressful Learning How to Learn Dedicated to Jeffrey Pfeffer. I didn\'t take Jeff\'s class ""Paths to Power"" when I was an MBA student at Stanford, but I discovered his work on power as a coach and it deeply informed not only my work with clients, but also my teaching when I later joined the Stanford faculty and became a junior colleague to Jeff. It\'s my understanding that I\'m the only faculty member who ever taught Interpersonal Dynamics (aka ""Touchy Feely"") and included Jeff\'s work on my syllabus, in part because I believe the course\'s T-groups are one of the best settings in which we can learn about power.

My understanding of De Waal\'s work suggests that while chimpanzee power struggles can turn violent and occasionally prove fatal, the vast majority involve dominance displays and the re-shuffling of hierarchical relationships rather than the elimination of rivals.

140,Building a Dynamic VRChat World (natalie.ee),https://blog.natalie.ee/posts/building-dynamic-vrchat-world/,5,"b'Building a Dynamic VRChat World natalie\'s blog Building a Dynamic VRChat World VRChat, its idiosyncrasies, and things I learned Nov 14, 2022 32 minute read Background I first tried VRChat in 2021 after a friend showed it to me, and I saved up and bought a headset as soon as I could. It was pretty much love at first sight and my only regret is not getting into it sooner. VRChat is a social VR application, originally released in 2014 and currently available on PC and Meta Quest platforms. In contrast to most video games, VRChat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any kind of plot. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like a platform than a game, where user-generated content is king and the analogue of \xe2\x80\x9cgameplay\xe2\x80\x9d revolves around users\xe2\x80\x99 interaction with that content and each other. Most players are using VR hardware, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also usable with a standard keyboard and mouse or gamepad. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that VRChat can\xe2\x80\x99t be a game! The main forms of content creation are avatars (the 3D models that users control) and worlds (the places in which they do it, like a game map). Several of the most popular VRChat worlds are in fact implementations of games, but worlds really run the gamut from intense games, to group exercise areas, educational communities, places to cuddle, dance clubs, trippy visuals, and more. A friend likened VRChat to a modern-day Geocities, and a return to the personal homepages of the 90s internet - it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely user-generated content with very little restriction on what you can publish, and (at present) almost no monetization. With the expression possible through social VR and the unprecedented development of the VRChat platform both by the company itself and the community, I believe it is something to be treasured, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something I want to contribute to. It has become extremely important in my life and has changed the way I interact with friends and loved ones forever. There is a lot of complexity to this and the freedom of the platform in this capitalist world may end up being its downfall one day, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a topic for another article :) My interest in chiptunes I had always had a love for chiptune music, but it really picked up in 2017 when I got into retro consoles. It has been said many times that an artist can sometimes produce better work when working under a set of restrictions than they could if given carte blanche to do whatever they desired, and I think chiptune is an excellent demonstration of this. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing that requires multidisciplinary knowledge to master - you\xe2\x80\x99re given a set of primitive ways to create sounds and it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely up to you to not only compose your music, but to construct the very sounds used in it. There are some toolkits that abstract away the programming side of it, but you really end up needing at least a basic understanding of the various synthesis parameters. Many of the best composers also had the skills to understand the hardware and write their own sound drivers in assembly. After getting a Sega Mega Drive to relive some childhood nostalgia, I ended up embarking on a multi-year project to create standalone devices to play this music using the original sound chips. The culmination of my efforts is in a project I\xe2\x80\x99ve called MegaGRRL, which ended up being released in a more DIY-friendly form factor as MegaGRRL Desktop. This project taught me a lot about hardware development and writing firmware, and I ended up gaining a pretty deep understanding of the sound chips used in the Mega Drive (and by extension, the whole Yamaha OPN series of chips). Storing binary data in weird places From my interest in obsolete video tech, I had been aware of PCM adaptors and products like ArVid. Video tape is a medium capable of dense digital data storage (for the time, at least), but the ability to do so is limited by VCRs only having standard video inputs and outputs. These products would encode/decode data to/from standard video signals, allowing the use of standard consumer VCRs instead of dedicated purpose-built decks (such as the Alesis ADAT XT or Technics SV-P100). Binary data was also commonly stored on audio tape in years past, something I had become intimately familiar with from my research into animatronics control systems. This typically worked in a similar method, using purpose-built encoders and decoders to allow the use of commercially available audiotape decks. A drawback of encoding data for audio instead of video is that the available bandwidth is much lower - typically on the order of a few thousand baud for the more common encoding methods in the 80s, and certainly for methods that can be expected to survive a trip through a modern lossy audio codec. If you\xe2\x80\x99re forced by some platform limitation to do a kind of archaic hack like this, using video is definitely the way to go. With this knowledge stored in the back of my mind, it was like a solution waiting for a problem to solve. Can the virtual world communicate with the outside world? Essentially immediately upon getting into VRChat, I went browsing through worlds looking for the most impressive productions. Many have beautiful level design with complex geometry and lighting that brought my PC to its knees, but this is something that people (whether rightfully or wrongfully) have come to expect from a modern game on a modern engine. Of greater interest to me personally were the numerous worlds that offload heavy processing to a GPU shader, for every purpose from simulating a huge ball pit to running Linux. Of course, what I was really looking for were worlds that pushed the boundaries of what the VRChat tooling allows creators to do, and I had finally started to find them. One world that caught my eye was Club Orion. There are a lot of club worlds in VRChat and the rave scene deserves its own article, but Orion got my attention due to the lighting in the world being controlled by DMX, a real-world lighting control standard used in the live event industry. I had already done some research into the possibilities of VRChat\xe2\x80\x99s SDK and knew that the only way to bring external data in-game (without using local MIDI or OSC) was to use video players. A few searches later, I found that Orion had implemented VR Stage Lighting, a (mostly) open source project. Looking at the project\xe2\x80\x99s Git repo confirmed what I had suspected - the DMX data was being brought into VRChat by being embedded into video. Sound familiar? SDK limitations So a few details about building worlds for VRChat. VRChat uses the Unity engine, and by extension all worlds are created in Unity. The primary limitation is that typical Unity scripting is not available to world creators. As VRChat lets anyone upload anything and Unity scripting is totally capable of doing all sorts of evil things to the user\xe2\x80\x99s computer, this obviously cannot be allowed. In the latest SDK version (SDK3), VRChat has implemented the \xe2\x80\x9cUdon VM\xe2\x80\x9d, executing a custom bytecode format. A graph-based language and visual editor known as Udon is available (similar to Unreal Engine\xe2\x80\x99s Blueprint). The Udon VM only has a few instructions - in fact, the full list is NOP, PUSH, POP, JUMP_IF_FALSE, JUMP, EXTERN, ANNOTATION, JUMP_INDIRECT, and COPY. EXTERN is the primary workhorse and simply calls .NET internals. In this way, VRChat can limit what functions are usable via EXTERN to ones deemed safe, and then the user has full freedom to write whatever they want while still being bound by those constraints in all cases. The Udon graph works great for those adding some simple scripting or interactivity to their worlds, but it\xe2\x80\x99s cumbersome to build anything complex when you\xe2\x80\x99re working with visual building blocks, and it\xe2\x80\x99s slow. Like really slow. You have to call out to .NET functions for basically everything, even basic arithmetic, and this incurs a lot of overhead, both in the Udon assembly and in VRChat\xe2\x80\x99s VM code. This is really just a fact of life that needs to be dealt with for VRChat world creators, and short of creative programming techniques or offloading processing to shaders, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much that can be done about it. That cumbersome nature has been solved by the UdonSharp project. Written by a community member who has since been hired by VRChat, U# takes the logical route of compiling C# code to Udon assembly. This allows creators to write code almost as if they were directly coding for Unity, without the need for visual scripting or writing assembly. As an aside, I hope especially with the hire of the U# author that VRChat can look into some optimizations for the Udon VM. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s some desire to have creators build compelling experiences without the overhead of a mountain of code behind them, but requiring a mountain of code is just the nature of some things that are being built. Offloading processing to shaders is certainly possible, but passing data to/from the shader incurs its own performance overhead, and makes it much more difficult to interact with the standard Unity API. I wanted to try building a world, and the idea was obvious With my general love for music (especially chiptune), and after browsing around some music visualizer worlds, the project idea basically invented itself. I\xe2\x80\x99d make a chiptune music visualizer world where the effects are driven by the raw sound chip data. No simple audio level meters or FFT processing here! We can see exactly which notes are being played, we can read all of the synthesis parameters, and we can do this for each channel on the sound chips individually which allows a very detailed look into the composition of these pieces of music. FM synthesis as used by the main YM2612 chip on the Mega Drive is a personal favorite of mine, so the decision was made - the YM2612 music visualizer project was born. First steps Immediately faced with the reality of having a cool idea but almost no clue how to make it happen, I started with a simple proof of concept of encoding and decoding data. Unity was completely alien to me but I had a good understanding of what needed to be done on the encoding side, so I set to work writing an encoder and trying to cobble together a simple decoder in Unity. A basic encoder was written, just encoding a few incrementing decimal values, with each bit of data output to an 8x8 pixel video region - black for a 0 bit, white for a 1 bit. With each bit taking an 8x8 block, a 1920x1080 video can store almost 4KB of data per frame. I decided to double this resolution, using a 1920x2160 video frame with half for encoded data, and half for video content. I wanted to render oscilloscope views of each sound chip channel, and all ten would fit nicely in a 1920x1080 area with good resolution. The initial encoder took in the raw data and output a series of PNG files, one for each frame, which would be assembled into a video by ffmpeg. Obviously, at 1920x1080 60 FPS, the storage requirements get ridiculous very quickly. Some documentation browsing later, I had ffmpeg doing all the work - taking the binary data in, converting it to a visual representation, scaling it so each bit was an 8x8 block, and combining the video to output a final MP4. Back in Unity, I got a simple media player created, and set out to write the decoder. This was my first time using Udon, UdonSharp, and actually my first time using Unity at all, so it was an uphill battle. Immediately it became apparent that performance was going to be a serious concern, and sure enough it was something I had to keep in mind from the very first prototype up until final release. Not only was there serious overhead from decoding the data bit-by-bit in Udon, but the time it took to just copy in the entire 1920x2160 video frame was destroying the framerate. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exact numbers, but it was bad. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t shrink the video resolution because I needed it for the oscilloscope views. There needed to be some kind of intermediate step, to take in the full video frame and output a small, optimized texture that could then by read by Udon efficiently. Oh no, I have to learn how shaders work Let me begin this section with a disclaimer: I\xe2\x80\x99m not a shader expert. I\xe2\x80\x99m hardly anything more than a shader beginner, and my knowledge is entirely specific to this domain of the sort of processing I needed to do for my world. If you need a shader to apply a visual effect to something, I\xe2\x80\x99m not your gal, I have no clue. As such, please don\xe2\x80\x99t take anything here as The Right Way To Do Things - it\xe2\x80\x99s simply what I figured out and what ended up working for me. There are probably lots of optimizations that could be done, or better methods altogether. The solution to my problem, as in so many impressive worlds, was to offload processing to a shader. It was my first time writing a shader and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one of those things that seems extremely daunting until you actually try it. I was surprised that I could write code in a very natural way. After an evening of learning and experimentation, I had created a pixel shader that could decode data from the video and output to a small 64x64 texture, which is much faster to read and process from Udon. In the context of the full system in the world, this works as follows: The media player outputs the video image to a render texture. The render texture is used as an input on the shader, with the shader assigned to a material on a surface hidden far away in the world. For each pixel output from the shader, it reads 8 pixels (8 bits) from the input. A camera pointing at this surface captures what it sees to a 64x64 render texture, which will thus contain the decoded data in the red channel, one byte per pixel. Finally, an Udon script reads that texture\xe2\x80\x99s color data into an array, which is then made available to other Udon scripts in the scene. This is all much faster than the 100% Udon-based system. The shader-based decoder was the key to improving performance, and is one aspect of the world that remained unchanged throughout all later development. Preparing the data - converting VGM to VRChat The de facto standard for storing Mega Drive chiptunes is VGM. VGM is not a sampled audio format like WAV or MP3, but instead stores the data written to the sound chips in order to reproduce a given piece of music. Files are comprised of data blocks and a series of commands - write X value to Y chip, delay for Z amount of time, seek to offset A in data block and output the value through register B on chip C, etc. The format supports a huge number of sound chips, but we really only care about the ones relevant to the Mega Drive (YM2612 and an SN76489 variant known as the \xe2\x80\x9cSega PSG\xe2\x80\x9d). VGM is a format I\xe2\x80\x99m very familiar with due to my work on MegaGRRL, and I have a parser I could drop into a project and go. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t be streaming VGM directly into VRChat for a number of reasons: The data rate is, in some cases, way too high. Decoding the data through a shader in realtime (to remain synced to the audio) means we cannot expect to receive a consistent stream of data, due to the varying framerate of the game client, which can often drop below the video\xe2\x80\x99s 60 FPS. Therefore, to avoid complicating the decoding process, each frame must contain the entire state needed by the world, with no reliance on past frames. With Udon\xe2\x80\x99s overhead, it would be impractically slow to maintain the state of the sound chips, apply the effects of commands to the state, and convert the state into useful information. Some tracks write to the sound chips tens of thousands of times per second. Thus the decision was made to write a converter, abstracting all of this, and storing all the information relevant to the world in each frame. This includes whether channels are keyed-on (playing a note), the frequency of the note on each channel, etc. Parsing VGM is non-trivial, and while MegaGRRL has solid code for handling it, I decided to modify an existing PC-based player rather than porting my firmware. An intermediate format was created, storing simple \xe2\x80\x9cwrite X to chip Y\xe2\x80\x9d commands, each with a timestamp. I hacked up vgmtest to silently play through a VGM file (faster than real-time - another reason I didn\xe2\x80\x99t base this on the MegaGRRL code) and output my simplified log format, and then began work on a conversion utility in C which would take in this log, store state internally, and then write out the world data for the entirety of the track (which would later be encoded to video by ffmpeg). The binary data half of the video frame primarily contains: Data ID, frame number, and other metadata Two seconds of upcoming frequency and key-on data Values representing the current audio level of each channel The entire set of YM2612 registers The current PCM data block playback position (presently unused in the world) The other half of the video frame contains an oscilloscope view for each channel, generated by Corrscope. This clip shows the raw video containing binary data (left) and its intermediate decoded form as output by the shader (right): Your browser doesn\'t support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead. Building the framework Obviously the main control available in the world would be a way to select what music to listen to. I intended to have a large number of game soundtracks available, so I made a basic UI allowing game selection, followed by track selection within that game. With the video decoder system, it seemed like a good idea to have this be completely server-driven, and I set to work on some tools to generate and encode a track index using a custom binary serialization format. The world would load this index when first launched, and decode it to populate the track selector. (For those curious, you can view the unencoded serialized data here) World construction progressed in a linear fashion, experimenting with different systems and learning Unity as I went. My background in various assembly dialects and bare-metal programming was useful in optimizing the Udon scripts, since Udon is relatively slow as discussed earlier. A lot of the common embedded tricks, such as LUTs and unrolled loops, are right at home here. There\xe2\x80\x99s not really much else to say about the overall control systems in the world\xe2\x80\xa6 it was pretty much a situation where what was required was obvious (tracklist display, seeking, continuing through playlists, syncing state to other users, etc) and I just sat down and banged it all out. While the player-to-player networking requirements for the world were simple, VRChat\xe2\x80\x99s networking system (and multiplayer game networking in general, really) is ripe for race conditions and other such problems. I\xe2\x80\x99m very thankful for one of my testers in particular, a skilled programmer in her own right, who was instrumental in helping me track down these problems throughout testing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing when a bug happens and someone immediately goes into troubleshooting mode, without even having any direct knowledge of the codebase. Effecting effects With access to the sound chip data, I implemented and tested various different effects that would be displayed in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s about 50/50 between what worked well and what ended up being scrapped. What worked Piano roll. Imagine note blocks falling as if onto a virtual keyboard, reminiscent of some popular MIDI visualizations on YouTube. This worked out great, aside from some performance concerns which will be discussed later. Particle blasters. Using frequency and audio level data to control the color and size of particles, I created audio-reactive particle blasters that players could pick up and aim around. This took some fine-tuning but also ended up working out great. Oscilloscope screens. Not much to say about these - they\xe2\x80\x99re just screens that display an oscilloscope view of each sound chip channel, and I knew they\xe2\x80\x99d work out well. Just a matter of sizing and positioning them so you can comfortably view them all in VR without having to look around too much. I also added some other data to the screens, like a colored bar based on the note being played, the audio level, left/right panning data, etc. Haptics. A last minute addition that I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly happy with. Most soundtracks have a profile defined that specifies how the audio level of the audio channels should affect controller vibration. The drawbacks here are the differences in how vibration works on different VR controllers, and how reactive the haptic feedback feels tends to vary from a nice pulsating buzz to a rough rattle depending on the controller used. Syncing to the audio was also a bit of a problem due to varying framerates, but I did what I could. AudioLink. There\xe2\x80\x99s a de-facto standard in VRChat known as AudioLink, used to apply sound-reactive effects to worlds and avatars. While this world obviously has its own method of reacting to music, I implemented AudioLink anyway so players with compatible avatars have working effects. What didn\xe2\x80\x99t work Particle bounce effects. Since the data includes advance knowledge of upcoming notes that would be played, I made some particle systems that would spawn particles of a frequency-derived color ahead of time, and they would bounce off the floor at the moment the note was actually being played. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out how to make this look very good, and the accuracy would drop at low framerates causing some notes to appear missed. Moving objects. These were really just based on some initial tests of using music notes to move blocks around. They hung around until the end but were scrapped before release as they just don\xe2\x80\x99t work well in VR. It was too difficult to scale their range of motion and position them in a way where they didn\xe2\x80\x99t require you to constantly move your head to see. \xe2\x80\x9cHexbugs\xe2\x80\x9d. Initially it seemed like a great idea to have some sound chips rattling around the world as the music played, but it proved too difficult to get them to behave well. They\xe2\x80\x99d either lay on the floor almost motionless, or zoom off into the air like a rocket. These could probably be made to work well, but I found the physics aspect of it too difficult to understand and they were scrapped. There are a number of chips laying around in the world that can be thrown at other players though :) Audio-controlled lights. Looked great, but realtime lighting is a performance killer so these were scrapped. Demo The announcement video for the world is a good overview of the effects that ended up being used: Your browser doesn\'t support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead. Learning to love VRCUrl When you pass a video URL to a media player, you\xe2\x80\x99d normally expect the URL to be a simple string. This is not the case in Udon. There is a special type, VRCUrl, which must be baked into the world at build time or created as a result of a user entering text into an input field. VRCUrls otherwise cannot be constructed or edited at runtime. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the docs explicitly state why this restriction exists, but my assumption is that it\xe2\x80\x99s for security reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s much more difficult to phone home data from a VRChat instance when you can\xe2\x80\x99t populate a URL with data fields. (This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped people though - there\xe2\x80\x99s a project that uses video players to call pre-baked Google Forms submission URLs!) In any event, I can\xe2\x80\x99t construct URLs at runtime, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it is. I\xe2\x80\x99m downloading and decoding an index file with a list of music tracks available in the world, but how can I specify the URL where each track is available? The solution was to bake an array of a few thousand URLs into the world using a custom Unity inspector, all simply specifying a track ID number. The data in the track index then specifies the index into the URL array to use for each track. Note: the mapping is not 1:1, as I have a \xe2\x80\x9crecommendations\xe2\x80\x9d playlist which points to tracks that already exist in their own game playlists. Getting it all running on\xe2\x80\xa6 a smartphone?! Shaders, part II I\xe2\x80\x99m being facetious here. The challenge was to get the world working on the native VRChat port for the Meta Quest, a series of headsets that use a mobile chipset and generally have a lot more in common with a smartphone than a desktop PC, down to running Android. The restrictions for VRChat content on Quest are a lot tighter when it comes to avatars, but for worlds you can do most of the things you can do on PC. Notable restrictions are a lack of post-processing support and a lower file size limit. As I was only using post-processing for a fade transition and my world didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot of data directly embedded in it, neither of these restrictions were a serious problem for me. While you\xe2\x80\x99re not too limited by what VRChat allows, you are absolutely limited by the reality of the Quest\xe2\x80\x99s hardware. Anything you do on PC that feels slow is going to feel much slower on Quest. It immediately became obvious that the piano roll was a serious performance hog. With it disabled I was in the 30 FPS range, but when enabled I was dropping down to 10-15. This was with only me in the world, and obviously framerates would drop even lower when the world was full of other players\xe2\x80\x99 avatars. Framerates weren\xe2\x80\x99t great on PC either, with me getting about 40-50 FPS on my mid-range gaming machine. 30 FPS is what I would consider the lower bound of what feels fluid in VR, so obviously something had to be done. Shaders are still an option on Quest. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some limitations due to running on a mobile GPU, but I just needed to read a texture and use that data to move cubes, hardly complicated stuff. A few hours of research and testing later, I had done it - the piano roll, originally controlled by Udon, had been converted to a vertex shader that would read the video data texture and act accordingly. Framerates on Quest more than doubled and PC had a similar reaction. Obviously pleased by these results, I doubled the length of the piano roll from one to two seconds, which looked great and still ran at a reasonable framerate. A side note: I think I could have gone further than two seconds and still had good performance, but I was starting to push the boundaries of how much data I could store in each video frame, and I simply didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like putting any effort into increasing it. I was very happy with how much data was being stored versus the video bitrate, and reliability was perfect, I never saw a corrupt frame. This is definitely one area that could be improved though. My encoding doing four bits per macroblock is not very dense. There were also some issues with aliasing of the data as it was read by the vertex shader, on the Quest version only. I never figured it out, but it may have something to do with sRGB color levels. What I ended up doing as a workaround was directly reading the video texture instead of the decoded data texture, where I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking for simple black/white values instead of needing 8 bits of precision per color. The performance impact of this, while initially concerning due to needing 16 texture reads instead of 2 for a 16-bit value, ended up being a total non-issue. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read that there is aggressive caching of tex2Dlod reads so I guess it ends up not mattering much. How VRChat media players work, and a little optimization Media players in VRChat\xe2\x80\x99s PC version are quite unique. Not only can you play a direct link to a video file (via HTTP/HTTPS) or stream (RTSP, HLS, etc), but links to sites like YouTube and Vimeo are supported, despite them not serving plain video files. This is supported with the help of a bundled copy of yt-dlp. For example, consider a user plays a link to a YouTube video. VRChat will run yt-dlp with some parameters to get the link to a direct MP4, and then pass that link to the actual media player component. The issue, and this is really a minor thing but it bothered me and I fixed it, is that all links are run through yt-dlp. This includes my own direct links to MP4s on my server, which don\xe2\x80\x99t need that extra step to \xe2\x80\x9cresolve\xe2\x80\x9d a direct MP4 link the way YouTube does. I had just switched to having my media server do a 302 redirect to BunnyCDN, and I noticed videos were now taking significantly longer to load. Some investigation revealed that several unnecessary steps were being taken. The URL is requested to play in VRChat. VRChat calls yt-dlp with the following parameters: --no-check-certificate --no-cache-dir --rm-cache-dir -f ""mp4[height<=?$RES][height>=?64][width>=?64]/best[height<=?$RES][height>=?64][width>=?64]"" --get-url ""$URL"" (where $RES is the maximum vertical resolution specified in the component properties and $URL is the requested URL). yt-dlp requests that URL from my server. My server responds with a 302 redirect to BunnyCDN where the actual video file can be found. yt-dlp follows the 302, making a request to BunnyCDN for the media. yt-dlp downloads up to a megabyte or two of media, before deciding that yes, this is indeed media, and returning the resulting media URL to VRChat. VRChat passes the URL returned from yt-dlp to the media player component, and playback begins. The issue presented is the extra time and wasted bandwidth spent by yt-dlp requesting the media file, only to throw it away and then have VRChat load it again. My initial attempt at optimizing this (while keeping media served by a redirect from my server - I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to embed CDN URLs directly into the world) was as follows: Return 200 with some dummy content for user agents matching what yt-dlp uses (Chrome with a randomized version). Return 302 for all other user agents. While this prevented yt-dlp from starting to download the media file, it was not much of a speed improvement, as I had really just switched who is following the 302 - instead of yt-dlp doing it, the VRChat media player backend now had to. Moreover, while yt-dlp is forced to run for all requests no matter what, the time spent launching it and making a request were being wasted by deliberately serving it garbage. This solved the problem of excess data being transferred, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t really make things faster. After some discussion on the Fediverse, it was suggested that I try to take advantage of yt-dlp\xe2\x80\x99s generic link extractor, and it worked! Return 200 for yt-dlp\xe2\x80\x99s user agent, but this time with a dummy HTML5 video element, where the source points to the media on the CDN. yt-dlp returns the actual destination media URL to VRChat. No request for the media is made by yt-dlp. Return 302 for all other user agents. This really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter anymore, as VRChat\xe2\x80\x99s media player backend is now requesting the target media directly! For those interested, the NGINX config looks like this: location ~ ^/v2/track/(?<trackid>[0-9]+)$ { if ($http_user_agent ~* Chrome) { #ytdlp add_header Content-Type text/html; return 200 ""<video width=\\""192\\"" height=\\""216\\"" controls><source src=\\""http://vrchat-fmc-pc.cdn.natalie.ee/trax/$trackid.mp4\\"" type=\\""video/mp4\\""></video>""; } return 302 http://vrchat-fmc-pc.cdn.natalie.ee/trax/$trackid.mp4; } Side note: Using such a coarse user agent filter (\xe2\x80\x9cChrome\xe2\x80\x9d) is okay here as the media server is not intended to serve web browsers. There are only three client types we really care about - yt-dlp for PC, WMFSDK for PC, and either stagefright or AVProMobileVideo on Quest. HTTPS Everywhere! Well, except here\xe2\x80\xa6 One thing that came up during early testing and was never completely resolved is that none of the media files would load for a few people. If one person has the problem it\xe2\x80\x99s probably their fault, but when it\xe2\x80\x99s multiple then I need to look into it, so I worked with an affected person who very patiently helped me troubleshoot and provided info from her end. Upon examining the VRChat client logs we found that yt-dlp was dying with a certificate error, which was weird because I could not find anything wrong with the server. The server is using a Let\xe2\x80\x99s Encrypt certificate and these problems were only a few months after the LE root certificate change, which caused problems for a lot of people who were behind on OS updates (and thus updates to their root certificate stores). But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case here, she was fully updated and we confirmed the media server was working in all other browsers on her PC. She did not have any kind of antivirus or middlebox interfering with her network connection. We tried manually passing the URL to the yt-dlp exe that VRChat distributes (in case it was using its own embedded cert store - I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how compiling a Python app for Windows works) and confusingly, it worked! This became even more confusing upon discovering that not only did her exe file (not working in-game) match mine (working in-game), but VRChat is passing the --no-check-certificate flag anyway, so certificate issues shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! We never really got to the bottom of this. On the server side I tried various combinations of allowed SSL/TLS versions and ciphersuites, and even switched to the alternate LE certificate chain, with no luck at all. I could\xe2\x80\x99ve rolled the dice by purchasing a paid certificate from another vendor or proxying all the traffic through a CDN like Cloudflare, but neither of these were something I wanted to do. Eventually, I compromised and switched to plaintext HTTP requests for the PC version of the world. The risk by using plain HTTP here is pretty low, and it resolved the problem for everyone who was experiencing it. If anyone knows what\xe2\x80\x99s up with this, I\xe2\x80\x99d be very interested to hear from you. Release There\xe2\x80\x99s not really a whole lot to say about release. Other than Unity crashes delaying my planned release time by about an hour, publishing the world went really smoothly. 60GB of media was served within two or three hours and by the next day the world had already made it out of Community Labs (where newly published VRChat worlds go until they get enough traffic - users must opt-in to see this). I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent too much time in public instances, but the general vibe seems to be \xe2\x80\x9cthose who know, know\xe2\x80\x9d. This is definitely not a world with general appeal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I made it specifically for chiptune enthusiasts, and if anyone else gets a kick out of it, that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice bonus as well. Post-release fixes - AVPro saves the day A persistent issue I noticed while building and testing the world was that the VRChat client lagging would result in audio stuttering. Serious stuttering, like one or two seconds of no audio at all followed by a few little glitches once it started playing again. I had initially dismissed this as a non-problem - if you were doing something that causes hitches like playing with VRC\xe2\x80\x99s photo camera, you could deal with some audio weirdness for a few seconds. But as VRChat introduced a new client UI (which actually caused serious hitching as you navigated around it), I decided something needed to be done. Furthermore, after the world was released and getting some traffic, we also could tell when someone new joined the instance as the audio would stutter while their avatar loaded. Needless to say, this was kind of ruining the experience. VRChat offers two media player backends - the Unity player, and AVPro. I knew from spending many hundreds of hours watching videos in other worlds that the AVPro player wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as susceptible to this problem, but I had refrained from using it in my world as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work in Unity\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplay mode\xe2\x80\x9d, which would have made world development extremely cumbersome. The time had finally come to deal with this. I had read some comments in community Discords that importing the AVPro trial package would let it work in play mode, but this didn\xe2\x80\x99t work for me. As a result, I ended up writing wrappers around all media player functions, so the Unity player could be used in the editor and the AVPro player while in the VRChat client. This also required a few helper objects to switch player-dependent material settings. This is another area that could be improved upon\xe2\x80\xa6 there may have been a cleaner way to handle this, but I needed it done ASAP so I went with what I knew. Reality This section will be very frank. Building this world was one of the least fulfilling projects I have worked on in several years. Not exactly the happiest way to end this article, is it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s done. I learned a hell of a lot building it and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty happy with the end result. The main issue is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly interested in gamedev (at least on the client side), and a lot of the skills I picked up while working on this are skills I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have any desire to learn, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think I will have much use for in the future. Time will tell, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my feeling right now. I think about this as a VRChat project first and foremost - Unity was merely a tool I needed to learn to reach the goal I wanted, rather than learning it being a goal in its own right. A lot of time was spent fighting with tools (if I had a nickel for every Unity crash\xe2\x80\xa6) and development was at times literally painful. Building something for VRChat specifically is what made it worth it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would have pushed through if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have as much emotional investment in the platform and a desire to bring things I love together\xe2\x80\xa6 chiptune music and social VR. This is not the end of my VRChat-related development. VRChat isn\xe2\x80\x99t the problem here at all anyway. I have several other world ideas I\xe2\x80\x99d like to make a reality, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be tempering my expectations, and generally trying to take it easy and not push myself toward any particular result. In the meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting back to my hardware development and trying to push my skills further there. You can catch me in VRChat a few times a week, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t catch me in Unity anywhere near as much. Final words Thank you for making it to the end. I hope this writeup has been informative and not structured too badly like spaghetti :). Feel free to check out the world, and if you have any thoughts you\xe2\x80\x99d like to share, my socials are on my website. I would like to extend a special thanks to my testers (you know who you are <3) who provided valuable feedback and put up with my constant iteration on this project, and the people of the \xe2\x80\x9cRedahs Nilrem\xe2\x80\x9d Discord server, who I have not interacted with directly, but were the source of many chatlogs I searched to find information about weird Unity and VRChat issues I was having. And if you are even the slightest bit interested in social VR, I implore you to check out VRChat as soon as you can. The platform is really something special. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it slip away before you get to experience it yourself. \xc2\xa9 2022 natalie\'s blog Built with Hugo Theme Stack designed by Jimmy'"

All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ernest Hemingway Introduction Looking back, I always struggled with writing. I felt pain every time I try to fill a blank page. I could bear the pain of writing in high school, but I almost gave up in university. I could read many books and understand the lectures, but give me a writing task? My mind went blank as if I never understood any of the concepts. Maybe I do not understand what I learned and the struggle to write is a symptom. Or it could be that I have been reading bad writings in university, which affects my thought process. Or maybe some concepts are complex, and I struggle to communicate them. Nonetheless, writing is my major weakness. I tried to search for help with my writing. Reading books on writing did nothing. Most books tend to give generic advice such as \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t use passive voice\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBe clear\xe2\x80\x9d. These are bad advices, similar to how \xe2\x80\x9cjust be yourself\xe2\x80\x9d is the worst dating advice. Everyone knows you should do it, but no one tells you why it works. How do I isolate the mechanics of writing and focus on each component one by one, thereby improving my writing? After further research, I have explored the potential answers to these questions. This article will outline the aspects of good writing namely clarity, cohesiveness, emphasis and conciseness. Table of Contents1. Good writing is clear2. Good writing is cohesive3. Good writing has emphasis4. Good writing is concise Good writing is clear Clear prose is one that a reader can understand. But it is not enough merely to be understandable. A statement can be easily understood yet tells nothing interesting to the reader. That is a common flaw in clickbait journalism like BuzzFeed. Readers can understand it, yet it does not captivate anyone. So, what makes prose clear and good? Clear prose is good when it tells a story. A story has two components \xe2\x80\x93 characters and actions. The characters are the subjects of the sentences that name the cast of the characters. Meanwhile, the actions are the verbs that go with these subjects. Every prose can be simplified using these two principles. When your prose seems too complex, locate the cast of characters and their actions. Remove the unnecessary information and focus on these two components. Once you have clear subjects and their action, add more information if needed. A prose may also be difficult to read when it has unnecessary nominalisations. Nominalisation is the process of making a noun from a verb or an adjective. Since nominalisation is a noun, it does not carry the same weight to the prose like an action word. Prose that contains a subject and a nominalisation lacks the element of a good story. Consider the following examples: 1. Our\xc2\xa0lack of knowledge\xc2\xa0about local conditions\xc2\xa0precluded\xc2\xa0determination of committee action\xc2\xa0effectiveness in\xc2\xa0fund allocation\xc2\xa0to those areas in greatest\xc2\xa0need of assistance. 2. Because we know nothing about the\xc2\xa0local conditions, we could not determine how effectively the committee had allocated funds to areas that need the most assistance. Readers will find (2) clearer than (1). Not only (2) relies on fewer nominalisations than (1), it also uses more verbs that express actions. (2) also tells the readers a story. There are clear subjects (we, committee)\xc2\xa0and the actions\xc2\xa0know, determine and allocate.\xc2\xa0This creates a clear story in (2) and makes it more interesting than (1). Good writing is cohesive Cohesive prose means that the separate sentences that form the prose flow into a single, unified whole. Williams and Colomb (1990) illustrate the principle of cohesion: \xe2\x80\x9cPut at the beginning of a sentence those ideas that you have already mentioned, referred to, or implied, or concepts that you can reasonably assume your reader is already familiar with, and will readily recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d The principle suggests that we focus on one concept at a time. Prose that does this will have a consistent topic string, which will make it feels more focused and cohesive. Prose that breaks this rule, such as an arduously long sentence usually does not focus on one topic. Hence, the reader will struggle to assemble these concepts into a cohesive discourse. Consider the following examples: 1. The\xc2\xa0hotel\xc2\xa0is famous.\xc2\xa0It\xc2\xa0is one of the most well-known hotels in the country. The latest international dancing competition\xc2\xa0was held at the hotel. The\xc2\xa0hotel\xc2\xa0spent a lot of money to advertise the event. Because\xc2\xa0the hotel\xc2\xa0wanted to gain an international reputation. But not\xc2\xa0many people\xc2\xa0attended the event.2. The hotel, which is one of the most well-known hotels in this region, wanted to promote its image around the world by hosting the latest international dancing competition. Although\xc2\xa0the event\xc2\xa0was widely advertised, not many people participated in the competition. The first paragraph has inconsistent topic strings, such as\xc2\xa0hotel, international dancing competition\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0people. These topics strings are not introduced properly, hence, it feels disjointed. Furthermore, the characters do not have any actions attached to it, making the paragraph lacks a story. The lack of story and the inconsistent topic strings make the paragraph confusing. Compare this to the second paragraph, where it has only two topic strings,\xc2\xa0hotel\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0event. The character,\xc2\xa0hotel\xc2\xa0has an action\xc2\xa0wanted.\xc2\xa0The combination of a character and an action creates a story in the sentence. In addition, the second sentence starts by repeating\xc2\xa0the event, which the writer has mentioned in the first sentence. Therefore, the second paragraph has a story and consistent topic strings. As a result, the paragraph feels more cohesive. Good writing has emphasis Prose has a good emphasis when it ends itself well. To emphasise, Williams and Colomb (1990) suggest readers to: \xe2\x80\x9cPut at the end of your sentence the newest, the most surprising, the most significant information: information that you want to stress \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps the information that you will expand on in your next sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d Most writers struggle to write well when the subjects use technical terms. Technical terms are confusing when they are not introduced properly. This technique is helpful when communicating complex information that requires technical terms. When you introduce complex information, design the sentence that it appears in, so that you can locate that term at the end. Why does this work? When you end a sentence with a good emphasis, the readers know what to expect in the sentence. A sentence that does not end with an emphasis, will feel monotonous. Also, putting the emphasis at the end has more impact on the reader\xe2\x80\x99s feeling. Consider the following examples: 1. My friend John commented, \xe2\x80\x9cThe movie Captain America was thrilling\xe2\x80\x9d.2. \xe2\x80\x9cThe movie Captain America was thrilling\xe2\x80\x9d, my friend John commented. In the first sentence, the word\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthrilling\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0is the emphasis, which is a strong endorsement for the film. In the second example, the sentence ends with the word\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9ccommented\xe2\x80\x9d,\xc2\xa0which does not carry any impact. Meanwhile, the word\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthrilling\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0is buried in the middle of the sentence. This diminishes its impact to the readers. Good writing is concise Prose is concise when it gives a lot of information clearly and in the fewest words. Williams and Colomb (1990) outline two principles to be concise: a. Compress what you mean into the fewest wordsb. Don\xe2\x80\x99t state what your reader can easily refer Principle (a) means writers should remove any redundancy or unnecessary wordiness in the prose. Principle (b) means that we remove attribution that does not add anything to the prose. One way that a writer can violate these two principles is by using an attribution. An attribution tells the reader the source of ideas or facts. When the attribution does not add anything to the point, it should be removed. Consider the following examples: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular patterns of drought and precipitation\xc2\xa0have been found\xc2\xa0to coincide with cycles of sunspot activity\xe2\x80\x9d which can be simplified to: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular patterns of drought and precipitation coincide with cycles of sunspot activity\xe2\x80\x9d Not only the phrase \xe2\x80\x9chave been found\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0adds nothing to the prose, it also does not state the subject. Removing the phrase will make the prose above more concise. Conclusion To conclude, I have identified the aspects of good writing, which are clarity, cohesiveness, emphasis and conciseness. Any writer who aspires to improve their crafts should practice these aspects. Nonetheless, these are not the panacea for all your struggles with writing. There are many other aspects of good writing. And only with continuous practice and the iterative process of writing will help you to improve this craft.

Concision in writing is good, for academic or professional work mostly. Even then, we find some good authors tend to make simple sentences difficult that we have to read twice, if not more. I\xe2\x80\x99d personally go for finding my own flair in writing. It gives out my own personality, my emotions at the time of the writing, and it tells a lot about my own tone of reading my own writing.

That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes a writing impactful. It is not facts and figures that move people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts, but passion and emotion.

What separates a beginner and an intermediate(to an extent, a master) is the effort put to just start writing, keep on writing, and re-writing no matter how bad it seems at first. It will only get better in the long-run. LikeLike Reply Christiaan Bodt says: October 29, 2020 at 11:38 am Hi, Very interesting.

Is it just you citing this text? Thanks, LikeLike Reply Adam Faliq says: October 30, 2020 at 12:17 pm Hi Christiaan, Thanks for commenting. In this post, each sentence has its own subject and verb. The characters are the subjects and the actions are the verbs that I use. In the example: 1. The hotel is famous. It is one of the most well-known hotels in the country. The latest international dancing competition was held at the hotel. The hotel spent a lot of money to advertise the event. Because the hotel wanted to gain an international reputation. But not many people attended the event. 2. The hotel, which is one of the most well-known hotels in this region, wanted to promote its image around the world by hosting the latest international dancing competition. Although the event was widely advertised, not many people participated in the competition. The character in these examples is the \xe2\x80\x9chotel\xe2\x80\x9d. In (1), the first three sentences do not have an action verb. Compare that to (2), which attach a clear action verb, \xe2\x80\x9cwanted\xe2\x80\x9d to the character. The second example feels clearer than the former. A character does not have to be a person, it could also be an abstract concept. I found about these aspects of writing in the book. I have also expanded on them based on my experience. I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend you to go over the resources as they are helpful. Thank you.

Table of Contents Why? Features Quickstart API Running Docker Options Running Locally From Source Code SaaS Performance tests Opened tickets for images related features Contribute License Todo Why? We wrote a big blog on this, and here is TLDR: Transformimgs is an image CDN for Web, so API must cover typical use cases, like thumbnails, zoom in product images, etc. Any new API endpoints must solve the above problems. The goal is to have zero-config API that makes decisions based on the input, so you don\'t need to provide additional parameters like quality, output format, type of compression, etc. Therefore, this allows you to configure the integration once. New features, like new image formats, will work with your front end automatically without any changes. To achieve that goal we should keep API to bare minimum and hide the smartness in the implementation. Features Resize/optimises/crops raster (PNG and JPEG) images. AVIF / WebP support based on ""Accept"" header. Vary header support - ready to deploy behind any CDN. Responsive images support including high DPI (retina) displays Save-Data support Quickstart There is an example of running API behind reverse proxy with integration example in quickstart/ folder.

Illustration: Katherine Chadwick/The GuardianCompers are strategic in how they enter competitions. They know which will attract fewer entrants and therefore come with better odds; as well as those to avoid. Illustration: Katherine Chadwick/The GuardianFor those who frequently enter promotional competitions, the emotional rewards resemble those of gambling Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email Cynthia SearSat 19 Nov 2022 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 19 Nov 2022 20.02 ESTBella*, a Melburnian in her late 50s, is driving me between shopping centres. We\xe2\x80\x99re on a \xe2\x80\x9ccomp shop\xe2\x80\x9d, an expedition bouncing from store to store to buy products that are part of promotional competitions. As she steers around a corner, bottles of wine clang together in the boot and a slab of beer shuffles along the backseat. Despite the fact that Bella doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drink alcohol, her car has become a \xe2\x80\x9cbit of a hiding spot\xe2\x80\x9d from her family for the products she buys to enter competitions. Bella\xe2\x80\x99s daughter thinks comping is \xe2\x80\x9clike gambling\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cTell you what though, she loved the trip to Italy!\xe2\x80\x9dBella is one of more than 90 avid \xe2\x80\x9ccompers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 serial entrants of promotional competitions \xe2\x80\x93 who have taken part in my doctoral research, an ethnographic study of comping communities in Australia and the UK.Get lucky: meet the competition addicts raking in thousandsRead morePromotional competitions are everywhere \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll find \xe2\x80\x9cbuy to win\xe2\x80\x9d offers online and instore, at supermarkets, department stores, convenience shops and chemists. There is also an ecosystem of websites, forums and Facebook groups built around cataloguing competitions and discussing which to enter.It is perhaps unsurprising that the majority of compers are the primary shopper for their household, and female. Like Bella winning a trip to Italy, most compers I spoke to had celebrated at least one so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmajor win\xe2\x80\x9d (a holiday, a car or a big cash prize) and multiple \xe2\x80\x9clittle wins\xe2\x80\x9d (products and gift cards).Diane, for example, is in her 30s and is the mother of two young boys. She began comping after meeting Jo at her local mother\xe2\x80\x99s group on Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s eastern coast. Jo had won a trip to New York, among other smaller wins, and the two quickly became friends, finding and entering competitions together. Diane\xe2\x80\x99s first major win was an all-expenses-paid trip to Golden Door, a wellness resort in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning During one of our coffee dates Diane described weighing up whether to spend more than $100 on a cologne that would count as an entry into a competition to win a luxury holiday. She explained that because the contest was aimed at men, who tend to enter fewer competitions than women, and due to the high price point, \xe2\x80\x9cit won\xe2\x80\x99t have many entries\xe2\x80\x9d. Plus, she rationalised: \xe2\x80\x9cI could gift the cologne to my husband for Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s an addiction and it attracts people with addictive personalitiesBellaCompers like Diane and Bella are strategic in how they enter competitions. They know which will attract fewer entrants and therefore come with better odds; as well as those to avoid, else become another number on a scam caller\xe2\x80\x99s list. Often compers prefer a particular type of competition. Some like entering games of skill which require a creative response to a question or challenge (for instance: \xe2\x80\x9cin 25 words or less describe why you deserve a trip to Thailand\xe2\x80\x9d) while others prefer games of chance (buy this product and keep your receipt to enter).While the prizes are comping\xe2\x80\x99s obvious drawcard, compers also describe the emotional payoffs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never forget a win, where you were, what you were doing \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s such a rush,\xe2\x80\x9d Bella says. She also says: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming around the corner.\xe2\x80\x9dDiane says this sense of potential lifted her from \xe2\x80\x9ca rut\xe2\x80\x9d she found herself in during maternity leave. She recommends comping to her female friends who might be entering a rut themselves. As one UK comper put it: \xe2\x80\x9cMany people buy a lottery ticket and hope for a positive outcome. Compers may do that [too] but look for other opportunities to gain some treats and extras. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know on a daily basis when you might receive a phone call, text, email, letter or surprise parcel and that adds excitement to everyday life.\xe2\x80\x9dComping can also become a compulsion. Bella explains: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an addiction and it attracts people with addictive personalities.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, two compers I spoke to began comping in ultimately successful attempts to overcome gambling addictions. One said it gave her the same \xe2\x80\x9cthrills\xe2\x80\x9d as gambling but \xe2\x80\x9cwithout the debt\xe2\x80\x9d.Comping takes time and, when a product purchase is required, money. While most compers justify such expenditure, some feel uneasy about the way the activity can hold their attention.Edith, for example, who is in her 60s and lives in Melbourne\xe2\x80\x99s suburbs, told me comping coincided with a period when she spent a lot of time and lost considerable money playing slot machines.She believed comping inspired her to play the slot machines and vice versa. Both activities kept her focused on the possibility of the win, the \xe2\x80\x9cthrill of the chase\xe2\x80\x9d.Sign up to Saved for LaterFree weekly newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Victorian and Edwardian England, when lotteries were outlawed, promotional competitions could be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cdisguised lotteries\xe2\x80\x9d and some organisers faced persecution accordingly. UK advertisers have only been legally able to offer game of chancecompetitions, for which entry requires a \xe2\x80\x9cqualifier\xe2\x80\x9d or product purchase, since 2007.In Australia, these competitions have been legal for decades, although organisers may need a permit.Today gambling is so normalised in both countries \xe2\x80\x93 through betting apps, websites, television commercials, billboards, betting stores and slot machines \xe2\x80\x93 that a \xe2\x80\x9cchance to win\xe2\x80\x9d sticker at the supermarket seems quaint and playful.But whether it\xe2\x80\x99s buying a specially marked chocolate bar or spending an evening at the casino, all these phenomena hold our attention by giving us \xe2\x80\x9cthrills\xe2\x80\x9d: experiences of anticipation and potentiality.

145,The largest dam demolition in history is approved for a California river (npr.org),https://text.npr.org/1137442481,4,"b'The largest dam demolition in history is approved for a Western river Text-Only Version Go To Full Site NPR > Environment The largest dam demolition in history is approved for a Western river By The Associated Press Thursday, November 17, 2022 \xe2\x80\xa2 2:54 PM EST PORTLAND, Ore. \xe2\x80\x94 U.S. regulators approved a plan Thursday to demolish four dams on a California river and open up hundreds of miles of salmon habitat that would be the largest dam removal and river restoration project in the world when it goes forward.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\'s unanimous vote on the lower Klamath River dams is the last major regulatory hurdle and the biggest milestone for a $500 million demolition proposal championed by Native American tribes and environmentalists for years. The project would return the lower half of California\'s second-largest river to a free-flowing state for the first time in more than a century.Native tribes that rely on the Klamath River and its salmon for their way of life have been a driving force behind bringing the dams down in a wild and remote area that spans the California and Oregon border. Barring any unforeseen complications, Oregon, California and the entity formed to oversee the project will accept the license transfer and could begin dam removal as early as this summer, proponents said.""The Klamath salmon are coming home,"" Yurok Chairman Joseph James said after the vote. ""The people have earned this victory and with it, we carry on our sacred duty to the fish that have sustained our people since the beginning of time.""The dams produce less than 2% of PacifiCorp\'s power generation \xe2\x80\x94 enough to power about 70,000 homes \xe2\x80\x94 when they are running at full capacity, said Bob Gravely, spokesperson for the utility. But they often run at a far lower capacity because of low water in the river and other issues, and the agreement that paved the way for Thursday\'s vote was ultimately a business decision, he said. Related Story: This is why you don\'t see people-size salmon anymore PacifiCorp would have had to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in fish ladders, fish screens and other conservation upgrades under environmental regulations that were not in place when the aging dams were first built. But with the deal approved Thursday, the utility\'s cost is capped at $200 million, with another $250 million from a California voter-approved water bond.""We\'re closing coal plants and building wind farms and it all just has to add up in the end. It\'s not a one-to-one,"" he said of the coming dam demolition. ""You can make up that power by the way you operate the rest of your facilities or having energy efficiency savings so your customers are using less.""Approval of the order to surrender the dams\' operating license is the bedrock of the most ambitious salmon restoration plan in history and the project\'s scope \xe2\x80\x94 measured by the number of dams and the amount of river habitat that would reopen to salmon \xe2\x80\x94 makes it the largest of its kind in the world, said Amy Souers Kober, spokesperson for American Rivers, which monitors dam removals and advocates for river restoration.More than 300 miles of salmon habitat in the Klamath River and its tributaries would benefit, she said.The decision is in line with a trend toward removing aging and outdated dams across the U.S. as they come up for license renewal and confront the same government-mandated upgrade costs as the Klamath River dams would have had.Across the U.S., 1,951 dams have been demolished as of February, including 57 in 2021, American Rivers said. Most of those have come down in the past 25 years as facilities age and come up for relicensing.Commissioners on Thursday called the decision ""momentous"" and ""historic"" and spoke of the importance of taking the action during National Native American Heritage Month because of its importance to restoring salmon and reviving the river that is at the heart of the culture of several tribes in the region.""Some people might ask in this time of great need for zero emissions, \'Why are we removing the dams?\' First, we have to understand this doesn\'t happen every day ... a lot of these projects were licensed a number of years back when there wasn\'t as much focus on environmental issues,"" said FERC Chairman Richard Glick. ""Some of these projects have a significant impact on the environment and a significant impact on fish.""Glick added that, in the past, the commission did not consider the effect of energy projects on tribes but said that was a ""very important element"" of Thursday\'s decision. Related Story: \'It takes our purpose\': With no salmon, the Yurok tribe struggles with identity Members of the Yurok, Karuk and Hoopa Valley tribes and other supporters lit a bonfire and watched the vote on a remote Klamath River sandbar via a satellite uplink to symbolize their hopes for the river\'s renewal.""I understand that some of those tribes are watching this meeting today on the (river) bar and I raise a toast to you,"" Commissioner Willie Phillips said.The vote comes at a critical moment when human-caused climate change is hammering the Western United States with prolonged drought, said Tom Kiernan, president of American Rivers. He said allowing California\'s second-largest river to flow naturally, and its flood plains and wetlands to function normally, would mitigate those impacts.""The best way of managing increasing floods and droughts is to allow the river system to be healthy and do its thing,"" he said.The Klamath Basin watershed covers more than 14,500 square miles (37,500 square kilometers) and the Klamath itself was once the third-largest salmon producing river on the West Coast. But the dams, constructed between 1918 and 1962, essentially cut the river in half and prevent salmon from reaching spawning grounds upstream. Consequently, salmon runs have been dwindling for years. Related Story: Animal magnetism: How salmon find their way back home The smallest dam, Copco 2, could come down as early as this summer. The remaining dams \xe2\x80\x94 one in southern Oregon and two in California \xe2\x80\x94 will be drained down very slowly starting in early 2024 with the goal of returning the river to its natural state by the end of that year.Plans to remove the dams have not been without controversy.Homeowners on Copco Lake, a large reservoir, vigorously oppose the demolition plan and rate payers in the rural counties around the dams worry about taxpayers shouldering the cost of any overruns or liability problems. Critics also believe dam removal won\'t be enough to save the salmon because of changing ocean conditions the fish encounter before the return to their natal river. Related Story: \'One of the best nature shows\': A river is transformed after dams come down ""The whole question is, will this add to the increased production of salmon? It has everything to do with what\'s going on in the ocean (and) we think this will turn out to be a futile effort,"" said Richard Marshall, head of the Siskiyou County Water Users Association. ""Nobody\'s ever tried to take care of the problem by taking care of the existing situation without just removing the dams.""U.S. regulators raised flags about the potential for cost overruns and liability issues in 2020, nearly killing the proposal, but Oregon, California and PacifiCorp, which operates the hydroelectric dams and is owned by billionaire Warren Buffett\'s company Berkshire Hathaway, teamed up to add another $50 million in contingency funds.PacifiCorp will continue to operate the dams until the demolition begins.The largest U.S. dam demolition to date is the removal of two dams on the Elwha River on Washington\'s Olympic Peninsula in 2012.

Partners View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger As with every World Cup, at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar the players will be using a new ball. The last thing competitors want is for the most important piece of equipment in the most important tournament in the world\xe2\x80\x99s most popular sport to behave in unexpected ways, so a lot of work goes into making sure that every new World Cup ball feels familiar to players. I am a physics professor at the University of Lynchburg who studies the physics of sports. Despite controversies over corruption and human rights issues surrounding this year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, there is still beauty in the science and skill of soccer. As part of my research, every four years I do an analysis of the new World Cup ball to see what went into creating the centerpiece of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most beautiful game. The physics of drag Between shots on goal, free kicks and long passes, many important moments of a soccer game happen when the ball is in the air. So one of the most important characteristics of a soccer ball is how it travels through air. At low speeds, the air will only hug the surface of the front half of a soccer ball before peeling off in an organized way called laminar flow, as seen here in this wind tunnel photo. John Eric Goff, CC BY-ND As a ball moves through air, a thin layer of mostly still air called the boundary layer surrounds some part of the ball. At low speeds this boundary layer will only cover the front half of the ball before the flowing air peels away from the surface. In this case, the wake of air behind the ball is somewhat regular and is called laminar flow. At high speeds, the air flowing over a soccer ball will almost travel completely to the back of the ball before separating into chaotic swirls called turbulent flow. John Eric Goff, CC BY-ND When a ball is moving quickly, though, the boundary layer wraps much farther around the ball. When the flow of air does eventually separate from the ball\xe2\x80\x99s surface, it does so in a series of chaotic swirls. This process is called turbulent flow. When calculating how much force moving air imparts on a moving object \xe2\x80\x93 called drag \xe2\x80\x93 physicists use a term called the drag coefficient. For a given speed, the higher the drag coefficient is, the more drag an object feels. It turns out that a soccer ball\xe2\x80\x99s drag coefficient is approximately 2.5 times larger for laminar flow than for turbulent flow. Though it may seem counterintuitive, roughening a ball\xe2\x80\x99s surface delays the separation of the boundary layer and keeps a ball in turbulent flow longer. This fact of physics \xe2\x80\x93 that rougher balls feel less drag \xe2\x80\x93 is the reason dimpled golf balls fly much farther than they would if the balls were smooth. When it comes to making a good soccer ball, the speed at which the air flow transitions from turbulent to laminar is critical. This is because when that transition occurs, a ball begins to slow down dramatically. If laminar flow starts at too high a speed, the ball begins to slow down much more quickly than a ball that maintains turbulent flow for longer. Evolution of the World Cup ball The Adidas Telstar, featured in the 1970 and 1974 World Cups, is what many people imagine when they think of a soccer ball. shine2010, CC BY Adidas has supplied balls for the World Cup since 1970. Through 2002, each ball was made with the iconic 32-panel construction. The 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal panels were traditionally made of leather and stitched together. A new era began with the 2006 World Cup in Germany. The 2006 ball, called the Teamgesit, consisted of 14 smooth, synthetic panels that were thermally bonded together instead of stitched. The tighter, glued seal kept water out of the interior of the ball on rainy and humid days. Making a ball out of new materials, with new techniques and with a smaller number of panels, changes how the ball flies through the air. Over the past three World Cups, Adidas tried to balance the panel number, seam properties and surface texture to create balls with just the right aerodynamics. The smoother Jabulani ball from the 2010 South Africa World Cup received a lot of criticism for being slow in the air. Picture Alliance via Getty Images The eight-panel Jabulani ball in the 2010 South Africa World Cup had textured panels to make up for shorter seams and a fewer number of panels. Despite Adidas\xe2\x80\x99 efforts, the Jabulani was a controversial ball, with many players complaining that it decelerated abruptly. When my colleagues and I analyzed the ball in a wind tunnel, we found that the Jabulani was too smooth overall and so had a higher drag coefficient than the 2006 Teamgesit ball. The World Cup balls for Brazil in 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 the Brazuca \xe2\x80\x93 and Russia in 2018 \xe2\x80\x93 the Telstar 18 \xe2\x80\x93 both had six oddly shaped panels. Though they had slightly different surface textures, they had generally the same overall surface roughness and, therefore, similar aerodynamic properties. Players generally liked the Brazuca and Telstar 18, but some complained about the tendency of the Telstar 18 to pop easily.

Franck Fife via Getty Images 2022\xe2\x80\x99s Al Rihla ball The new Qatar World Cup soccer ball is the Al Rihla. The Al Rihla is made with water-based inks and glues and contains 20 panels. Eight of these are small triangles with roughly equal sides, and 12 are larger and shaped sort of like an ice cream cone. To make the Al Rihla rougher and more aerodynamic, Adidas put small divots into the surface. John Eric Goff, CC BY-ND Instead of using raised textures to increase surface roughness like with previous balls, the Al Rihla is covered with dimplelike features that give its surface a relatively smooth feel compared to its predecessors. To make up for the smoother feel, the Al Rihla\xe2\x80\x99s seams are wider and deeper \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps learning from the mistakes of the overly smooth Jabulani, which had the shallowest and shortest seams of recent World Cup balls and which many players felt was slow in the air. My colleagues in Japan tested the four most recent World Cup balls in a wind tunnel at the University of Tsukuba. When air flow transitions from turbulent to laminar flow, the drag coefficient rises rapidly. When this happens to a ball in flight, the ball will suddenly experience a steep increase in drag and slow down abruptly. Most of the World Cup balls we tested made that transition at roughly 36 mph (58 kph). As expected, the Jubalani is the outlier, with a transition speed around 51 mph (82 kph). Considering that most free kicks start off traveling in excess of 60 mph (97 kph), it makes sense that players felt the Jabulani was slow and hard to predict. The Al Rihla has aerodynamic characteristics very similar to its two predecessors, and if anything, may even move a bit faster at lower speeds. Every new ball is met with complaints from somebody, but the science shows that the Al Rihla should feel familiar to the players in this year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup.

On Saturday, Nov. 19, the Mission Management Team polled \xe2\x80\x9cgo\xe2\x80\x9d for Orion\xe2\x80\x99s outbound powered flyby past the Moon. NASA will cover the flyby live on NASA TV, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s website, and the NASA app starting at 7:15 a.m. EST Monday, Nov. 21. The burn is planned for 7:44 a.m. Orion will lose communication with Earth as it passes behind the Moon from 7:25 a.m. through 7:59 a.m., making its closest approach of approximately 80 miles from the surface at 7:57 a.m. During flight day four, flight controllers moved each solar array to a different position to test the strength of the WiFi signal with the arrays in different configurations. The Integrated Communications Officer, or INCO, tested the WiFi transfer rate between the camera on the tip of the solar array panels and the camera controller. The goal was to determine the best position to most efficiently transfer imagery files. Teams learned that having multiple cameras on at once can impact the WiFi data rate, and therefore, future solar array wing file transfer activities will be accomplished from one solar array wing at a time to optimize transfer time. The Emergency, Environmental, and Consumables Manager, or EECOM,\xe2\x80\xaftested Orion\xe2\x80\x99s radiator system. Two radiator loops on the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s European Service Module help expel excess heat generated by different systems throughout the flight. Flight controllers are testing\xe2\x80\xafsensors that maintain the coolant flow in the radiator loops, switching between different modes of operation and monitoring performance. During speed mode, the coolant pumps operate at a constant rate. This is the primary mode used during Artemis I. Flow control mode adjusts the pump speed as needed to maintain a constant flow through the system. The flight test objective is to monitor system performance and the accuracy of flow sensors to characterize the stability of this mode of operation.\xc2\xa0 Each loop is monitored in flow control mode for 72 hours to provide sufficient data for use on future missions. Star trackers are sensitive cameras that take pictures of the star field around Orion. By comparing the pictures to its built-in map of stars, the star tracker can determine which way Orion is oriented. The star trackers on Orion are located on the European Service Module on either side of the optical navigation camera. This Nov. 2019 photo was taken as the Orion crew and service module stack for Artemis I was lifted out of the Final Assembly and Test (FAST) cell. As part of planned testing throughout the mission, the guidance, navigation, and control officer, also known as GNC, performed the first of several tests of the star trackers that support Orion\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system. Star trackers are a navigation tool that measure the positions of stars to help the spacecraft determine its orientation. In previous flight days, engineers evaluated initial data to understand star tracker readings correlated to thruster firings. Engineers hope to characterize the alignment between the star trackers that are part of the guidance, navigation and control system and the Orion inertial measurements units, by exposing different areas of the spacecraft to the Sun and activating the star trackers in different thermal states. Just after 5:30 p.m. on Nov. 19,\xc2\xa0Orion had traveled\xc2\xa0222,823 miles from Earth and was\xc2\xa079,011 miles from the Moon, cruising at 812 miles per hour.\xc2\xa0You can track Orion via the Artemis Real-Time Orbit Website, or AROW. Overnight, engineers in mission control will uplink large data files to Orion to better understand how much time it takes for the spacecraft to receive sizeable files. On flight day five, Orion will undergo its third planned outbound trajectory correction burn to maneuver the spacecraft and stay on course to the Moon.
